problem is the grip in the front cup holders are way too tight they puncture the coffee cups very hard to get them in and out

i noticed that the car vibrated on acceleration  i thought it needed an alignment  it turned out that the ??power steering unit ?? had a leak in it and needed to be replaced which i was told was a rare phenomenon after the repairs were done it
see previous comment
i noticed that the sound coming from the right rear speaker was different when you played music from a cd vs radio vs media device  there was static popping and no richness to the quality of the music
very poor quality factory installed speakers  upgraded all speakers to better after-market speakers

leak in firewall
very moldy smell that was enough to make you sick
dealer is working on it
took to dealer to fix issue they did but now it is leaking worse than before  plus when the fixed the issue they made it harder to close the back glass on the tailgate  not happy with ford
rear glass on hatch was a very lite seal and allowed dirt to work in between the glas and the seal then when it rained it would leak
the cap less fuel tank would not seal
drivers door speaker would cut in and out again three trips to get it resolved
(copied from int97): the seats would soil very easily and would stain when you tried to clean them
(copied from hvac97): blower  resister quit working
it pulled out at the rear where the hatch closed
it took three trips to the dealer to get it fixed
transmission would sometimes delay shifting from one gear to the next
sound quality is very poor
air conditioning quit-no air at all
no cool air at all
passenger side speaker just started sounding tiney  not clear sound coming through
sometimes sounds like a piece of paper is stuck in there
doesnt seem to hold desired temperature  sometimes gets colder hotter when changing temperature setting
with the onset of winter notice the temperature does not hold when driving or when the someone enters or exits the car

battery needed to be replaced before 36 months
the automatic is not an automatic it is a self shifting manual  it does not work  i have gone to the dealer every couple of months and finally they replaced it  the same problem is now occuring in the replacement transmission  i am convince
see above  the transmission stutters from a standing stop  the only way to fix it is to manual shift from low to drive manually at 3500 rpm
there is road noise audible through the drivers side door at least  when i first owned the car i had thought that the door was ajar or the window not fully closed
in colder weather the speakers have a buzzing sound especially with spoken words  this is an intermittent problem
road noise is quite loud especially when going fast  i used to think that i had left the door ajar or a window open
as i learn the characteristics of the vehicle and as the vehicle learns from me this problem has become much less frequent
(copied from dexp97): when i would get out of car the brake lights would not turn off

i just need an alignment
my problem isnt listed above the housing for the steering column is missing a bracket so it isnt fully connected
speakers blew within six months had to replace
just many steps involved in doing simple tasks
plays songs not even close to what i wanted to play
they are aware of this as they extended  the warranty for the transmission
the struts on the focus wore out almost immediately after owning them
the electrical system in the car blew fuses on multiple occasions shutting the car off in the middle of driving  this left the car with no interior lights working after the fuses blew
one of the speakers has significant static coming out of it now
in general the sync function just has a very difficult time interpreting words correctly  in all systems and functions
occasionally the car will just be unable to find my device though nothing about it has changed or been altered  which leaves all bluetooth functions inoperable
the gps system frequently doesnt locate the car for minutes at a time meaning the system cant coordinate if the vehicle is on the navigated path
locations are often not found in the point of interest database  it also has a hard time finding specific street addresses when plugged in directly
the transmission had multiple issues with the clutch  i had to have it replaced twice since i owned it the most recent time from a focus-wide recall that ford issued

sound is loud enough that you have to increase volume on audio system to offset
this is the third pilot i have owned and this is the same issue with each one i was told by the dealership that this is due to the brakes overheating and that the rotors were warping i could pay to replace them but it may not fix the problem
it just seems that the braking distance is longer than it should could be
was told this is tied to the baking issues
speaker has low popping noise at times during talk radio broadcasts
system is cumbersome slow to respond and often does not recognize voice commands so i have stopped using it
accuracy of roadways is fair and addresses are not always easily found google is easeier
the latch that opens the rear cargo is not plastic and it does not either open or close easily
(copied from engtrn97): as fuel consumption is such an issue i often like to coast as much as possible i noticed that when i am trying to coast that the transmission is still engaged and places a drag on coasting actually slowing me down
the battery failure occurred once after leaving the accessories on for 30 minutes and another time under similar circumstances

very poor gas mileage after initial purchase which i didnt like but understood there would be a break-in period however im up to almost 50000 miles and the best combined mileage i get is around 24 mpg  even with strictly highway miles ive

although the fan under the seats is working it is very under-powered virtually no cooling
battery lasted 2 yrs 10 months  i think it should have lasted longer

(copied from fcd97): the front lights are dull  there is a heavy built on the lights that prevent them from shining bright and allowing me to see at night  it is extremely difficult to see in very dark streets
the quality of the speakers is very low  unfortunately i did realize it when i test drove the vehicle i never thought to check the speakers sound
the air conditioning does not cool enough i live in south texas where the temperature in the summer reaches 100 degrees on numerous days and the car is never cool enough  i bought the car in the winter so i failed to fully test the cooling system
i dont use the heater much since it doesnt get very cold in south texas but when i need it it takes too long to warm up and it never reaches a nice warm temperature

the center console materials chip very very easily

(copied from dexp97): car pulls to the right slightly when driving
i dont believe they were ever connected by the dealer when they prepped the car
(copied from hvac97): the vent outlet for the rear seat blows out very little air even when blower speed is on high
the embedded tab in the carpet has pulled loose and the floor mat has nothing to attach to
when going down at steep incline at highway speeds and when i take my foot off the gas peddle to coast the engine revs up about 1500 rpm and stays there until the car reaches the bottom of the incline or i step on the gas
the engine will increase rpm about 200-300 rpm when im slowing down at a stop sign or light
more insulation would likely help eliminate the excessive road noise
use more insulation
just a little squeak--i notice it when i am leaving work and slow to a stop before entering the roadway
the bass range hums excessively so i have to lean to treble range
(copied from seat97): the pneumatic height-adjust loses pressure and needs to be readjusted almost every time i get into the car  this only presents a problem for the under 53--thats me
this seems to be an atmospheric problem and is easily controlled with fan air temperature adjustments

they just sound very low poor quality especially as i go louder my original oem speakers in my 2001 dodge ram are much better speakers
(copied from dexp97): when i start the car the maint req light flashes on and off 7 times
noticed an vibration at low volume setting the audio system still works fine though
had to shave the seat a little a little worn from i guess getting in and out of the car

the speakers only make a crack or popping sound when i plug in the audio cable i think the audio cable maybe poor quality
when the air filter was replaced last month  it had a slight smell that has pretty much gone away
i think its the nature of the vehicle its an open cabin noise just echos around
i believe they use an inexpensive speaker for this car i upgraded stereo and speakers soon after purchase
the plastic cover materials scratch easily and also a crack in drivers door plastic
i didnt realize the car had six speakers  assumed it was just front speakers until when cleaning i saw them in the panels  turned out to be a blown fuse(s) that was there since it was purchased  taken care of during warranty and am very please
probably a cabin air filter  will get it looked at during the next major servicing

when fueling if key is left in ignition the gas gauge does not reflect the addition of gas nor the amount of miles left to empty  the only way that fuel input is correctly registered by gauge is if keys are completely removed from igntion
the passenger side front speaker doesnt work  have brought to attention of dealer when there for oil change and was told it was fixed but within a short time the same speaker stopped working again
the front air dam is very low and i continually scrape it on various parking featuresit is a design condition which im not sure if it can be categorized as a design flaw
the passenger side speaker would cut out but if you pressed on the fascia it would start up again  had dealer remove fascia and check connections but at the time everything seemed to be working properly problem has not re-occurred since

initial window power motors were not strong enough and motors were replaced by dealer and we have had no problem since
(copied from seat97): front driver seat when adjusting will slide all the way back and is difficult to readjust but can be done
dealership advised that the speaker was blown and that they would have to order another one - so far it has not been replaced
i am mostly replying to the connectivity of the phone charger  which has never worked
the dealership is going to replace it
the steering wheel is very faded

(copied from dexp97): wind noise in the window the door seals allow for wind noise while driving at highway speeds i have had the door seals replaced but i am not sure what the actual issue may be
this is a very recent problem i noticed in the last month that when braking quickly on the highway they shudder i plan to have them looked at soon
i have had the dealer look into this many times and they always say that there is nothing wrong i would prefer to go over speed bumps with me driving the car while they are with me this hasnt been successfully arranged
when shutting the window upon exiting the car the drivers side window kept going down when trying to slide the window it would get to a certain point and roll back down but not all the way it was very frustrating so i looked up the problem
they distort very easily it seems
today it kept dropping connection to my phone while on a meeting  driving into work
at cold temps changing the blower from feet to defroster makes a clicking sound
sometimes when the engine is cold and the outside temperature is cold it is very difficult to put into first gear
the only issue is that the clutch pedal clicks i dont like noises i plan on bringing this up during the next service i had to choose the answer above which doesnt really apply
if i was listening to audio and received a call the conclusion of the call does not automatically switch me back to the audio playback instead i have to do a workaround that involves brinigng up the voice command then cancelling it this so
brakes are not good or responsive enough requires too much pressure
water leaks out of nozzle after use
dealer will not remove for covers to locate and fix
bulb just stopped working
dealer said there was an alignment problem that should be fixed at the same time i get new tires installed
certain tones cause distortion from the front passenger side tweeter
rear speakers are fuzzy and cut out  now they generally only come on when music is loud and just produce static  driver rear side door had a speaker replaced at dealer and still did not fix the problem
(copied from int97): the silver writing: gti at the bottom of the steering wheel: the silver coating has flaked off  not a big issue at all  the steering wheel itself is leather wrapped and still in great condition
broken pump was the culprit
