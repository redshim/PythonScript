command children israel give levites inheritance possession cities dwell ye also suburbs round about
cities dwell suburbs cattle goods beasts
suburbs cities ye give levites reach wall city outward thousand cubits round about
ye measure without city on east side two thousand cubits south west north midst suburbs cities
among cities ye give levites there six refuge appoint manslayer may flee thither add forty two
so cities ye give levites forty eight suburbs
cities ye give possession children israel many few every one levites according inheritance inheriteth
lord spake moses saying
speak children israel say ye come over jordan land canaan
then ye appoint you cities refuge slayer may flee thither killeth any person at unawares
you cities refuge avenger manslayer die until stand before congregation judgment
these cities ye give six refuge
ye give three cities on side jordan land canaan refuge
these six cities refuge both children israel stranger sojourner among every one killeth any person unawares may flee thither
if smite instrument iron so die murderer surely put death
if smite throwing stone wherewith may die murderer surely put death
or if smite hand weapon wood wherewith may die murderer surely put death
revenger blood himself slay murderer meeteth
if thrust hatred or hurl at by laying wait die
or enmity smite hand die smote surely put death murderer revenger blood slay meeteth
if thrust suddenly without enmity or cast upon any thing laying wait
or any stone wherewith man may die seeing cast upon enemy neither sought harm
then congregation judge between slayer revenger blood according these judgments
congregation deliver slayer out hand revenger blood restore city refuge whither fled abide death high priest anointed holy oil
if slayer at any time come without border city refuge whither fled
revenger blood find without borders city refuge kill slayer guilty
because should remained city refuge until death high priest after slayer return land possession
so these things statute judgment you throughout your generations dwellings
whoso killeth any person murderer put death by mouth witnesses one witness testify against cause die
moreover ye take no satisfaction life murderer guilty death surely put
ye take no satisfaction fled city refuge should come again dwell land until death priest
so ye pollute land wherein blood defileth cannot cleansed shed therein by
defile therefore land ye inhabit wherein dwell lord among children israel
chief fathers families children gilead son machir manasseh sons joseph came near spake before moses princes israel
said lord commanded give land inheritance by lot children israel zelophehad our brother daughters

so inheritance children israel remove tribe every one keep himself fathers
every daughter possesseth inheritance any tribe children israel wife one family her father may enjoy man fathers

then job arose rent mantle shaved head fell down upon ground worshipped

job sinned nor charged god foolishly
again there day sons god came present themselves before lord satan also among himself
lord said satan whence comest thou answered going fro earth walking down
lord said satan hast thou considered servant job there none like earth perfect upright man one feareth god escheweth evil still holdeth fast integrity although movedst against destroy without cause

then said wife dost thou still retain thine integrity curse god die
said her thou speakest one foolish women speaketh what we receive good at hand god evil did job sin lips
now job's three friends heard evil come upon came every one own place eliphaz temanite bildad shuhite zophar naamathite had made appointment together mourn comfort
lifted eyes afar off knew voice wept rent every one mantle sprinkled dust upon heads toward heaven
so sat down upon ground seven days nights none spake word saw grief very great
after opened job mouth cursed day
job spake said
let day perish wherein born night said there man child conceived
let day darkness god regard above neither light shine upon
let darkness shadow death stain cloud dwell upon blackness day terrify
night let darkness seize upon joined days year come number months
lo let night solitary no joyful voice come therein
let curse day who ready raise mourning
let stars twilight thereof dark look light none neither see dawning day
because shut doors mother's womb nor hid sorrow mine eyes
why died womb did give ghost came out belly
why did knees prevent or breasts should suck
now should lain still been quiet slept then had at rest
kings counsellors earth built desolate places themselves
or princes had gold who filled houses silver
or hidden untimely birth had been infants never saw light
there wicked cease troubling weary at rest
there prisoners rest together hear voice oppressor
small great there servant free master
wherefore light given misery life bitter soul
long death cometh dig more than hid treasures
rejoice exceedingly glad can find grave
why light given man whose way hid whom god hath hedged
sighing cometh before eat roarings poured out like waters
thing greatly feared come upon afraid
safety neither had rest quiet yet trouble came
then eliphaz temanite answered said
if we assay commune thee wilt thou grieved who can withhold himself speaking
behold thou hast instructed many strengthened weak hands
thy words upholden falling thou hast strengthened feeble knees
now come upon thee thou faintest toucheth art troubled
thy fear confidence hope uprightness ways
remember pray thee who ever perished being innocent or where righteous cut off
even seen plow iniquity sow wickedness reap same
by blast god perish breath nostrils consumed
roaring lion voice fierce teeth young lions broken
old lion perisheth lack prey stout lion's whelps scattered abroad
now thing secretly brought mine ear received little thereof
thoughts visions night deep sleep falleth on men
fear came upon trembling made bones shake
then spirit passed before face hair flesh stood
stood still could discern form thereof image before mine eyes there silence heard voice saying
mortal man more just than god pure maker
behold put no trust servants angels charged folly
how much less dwell houses clay whose foundation dust crushed before moth
destroyed morning evening perish ever without any regarding
doth excellency go away die even without wisdom
call now if there any answer thee saints wilt thou turn
wrath killeth foolish man envy slayeth silly one
seen foolish taking root suddenly cursed habitation
children far safety crushed gate neither there any deliver
whose harvest hungry eateth taketh even out thorns robber swalloweth substance
although affliction cometh forth dust neither doth trouble spring out ground
yet man born trouble sparks fly upward
would seek god commit cause
doeth great things unsearchable marvellous without number
who giveth rain upon earth sendeth waters fields
set on high those low mourn may exalted safety
disappointeth devices crafty so hands cannot perform enterprise
taketh wise own craftiness counsel froward carried headlong
meet darkness daytime grope noonday night
saveth poor sword mouth hand mighty
so poor hath hope iniquity stoppeth her mouth
behold happy man whom god correcteth therefore despise thou chastening almighty
maketh sore bindeth woundeth hands make whole
deliver thee six troubles yea seven there no evil touch
famine redeem thee death war power sword
thou shalt hid scourge tongue neither afraid destruction cometh
at destruction famine thou shalt laugh neither afraid beasts earth
thou shalt league stones field beasts at peace thee
thou shalt know thy tabernacle peace visit habitation sin
thou shalt know also thy seed great thine offspring grass earth
thou shalt come thy grave full age like shock corn cometh season
lo we searched so hear know thou thy good
job answered said
oh grief throughly weighed calamity laid balances together
now would heavier than sand sea therefore words swallowed
arrows almighty within poison whereof drinketh spirit terrors god do set themselves array against
doth wild ass bray hath grass or loweth ox over fodder
can unsavoury eaten without salt or there any taste white egg
things soul refused touch sorrowful meat
oh might request god would grant thing long
even would please god destroy let loose hand cut off
then should yet comfort yea would harden myself sorrow let spare concealed words holy one
what strength should hope mine end prolong life
strength stones or flesh brass
help wisdom driven quite
afflicted pity should shewed friend forsaketh fear almighty
brethren dealt deceitfully brook stream brooks pass away
blackish by reason ice wherein snow hid
what time wax warm vanish hot consumed out place
paths way turned aside go nothing perish
troops tema looked companies sheba waited
confounded because had hoped came thither ashamed
now ye nothing see casting down afraid
did say bring or give reward your substance
or deliver enemy's hand redeem mighty
teach hold tongue cause understand wherein erred
how forcible right words what doth your arguing reprove
do ye imagine reprove words speeches one desperate wind
yea ye overwhelm fatherless dig pit your friend
now therefore content look upon evident you if lie
return pray you let iniquity yea again righteousness
there iniquity tongue cannot taste discern perverse things
there appointed time man upon earth days also like hireling
servant earnestly desireth shadow hireling looketh reward work
so am made possess months vanity wearisome nights appointed
lie down say arise night gone am full tossings fro dawning day
flesh clothed worms clods dust skin broken become loathsome
days swifter than weaver's shuttle spent without hope
o remember life wind mine eye no more see good
eye hath seen see no more thine eyes upon am
cloud consumed vanisheth away so goeth down grave come no more
return no more house neither place know any
therefore refrain mouth speak anguish spirit complain bitterness soul
am sea or whale thou settest watch over
say bed comfort couch ease complaint
then thou scarest dreams terrifiest through visions
so soul chooseth strangling death rather than life
loathe would live alway let alone days vanity
what man thou shouldest magnify set thine heart upon
thou shouldest visit every morning try moment
how long wilt thou depart nor let alone till swallow down spittle
sinned what do thee o thou preserver men why hast set mark against so am burden myself
why dost thou pardon transgression take away mine iniquity now sleep dust shalt seek morning
then answered bildad shuhite said
how long wilt thou speak these things words thy mouth like strong wind
doth god pervert judgment or almighty justice
if thy children sinned against cast away transgression
if thou wouldest seek god betimes make thy supplication almighty
if thou wert pure upright surely now would awake thee make habitation thy righteousness prosperous
though thy beginning small yet latter end should greatly increase
enquire pray thee former age prepare thyself search fathers
we yesterday know nothing because our days upon earth shadow
teach thee tell utter words out heart
can rush grow without mire flag water
whilst yet greenness cut down withereth before any other herb
so paths forget god hypocrite's hope perish
whose hope cut off trust spider's web
lean upon house stand hold fast endure
green before sun branch shooteth forth garden
roots wrapped about heap seeth place stones
if destroy place then deny saying seen thee
behold joy way out earth others grow
behold god cast away perfect man neither help evil doers
till fill thy mouth laughing lips rejoicing
hate thee clothed shame dwelling place wicked come nought
then job answered said
know so truth how should man just god
if contend cannot answer one thousand
wise heart mighty strength who hath hardened himself against prospered
removeth mountains know overturneth anger
shaketh earth out her place pillars thereof tremble
commandeth sun riseth sealeth stars
alone spreadeth out heavens treadeth upon waves sea
maketh arcturus orion pleiades chambers south
doeth great things past finding out yea wonders without number
lo goeth by see passeth on also perceive
behold taketh away who can hinder say what doest thou
if god withdraw anger proud helpers do stoop under
how much less answer choose out words reason
whom though righteous yet would answer make supplication judge
if had called answered yet would believe hearkened voice
breaketh tempest multiplieth wounds without cause
suffer take breath filleth bitterness
if speak strength lo strong judgment who set time plead
if justify myself mine own mouth condemn say am perfect also prove perverse
though perfect yet would know soul despise life
one thing therefore said destroyeth perfect wicked
if scourge slay suddenly laugh at trial innocent
earth given hand wicked covereth faces judges thereof if where who
now days swifter than post flee away see no good
passed away swift ships eagle hasteth prey
if say forget complaint leave off heaviness comfort myself
am afraid sorrows know thou wilt hold innocent
if wicked why then labour vain
if wash myself snow water make hands never so clean
yet shalt thou plunge ditch mine own clothes abhor
man am should answer we come together judgment
neither there any daysman betwixt us might lay hand upon both
let take rod away fear terrify
then would speak fear so
soul weary life leave complaint upon myself speak bitterness
say god do condemn shew wherefore thou contendest
good thee thou shouldest oppress despise work thine hands shine upon counsel wicked
hast thou eyes flesh or seest man seeth
thy days man years man's
thou enquirest after mine iniquity searchest sin
thou knowest am wicked there none can deliver out thine hand
thine hands made fashioned together round about yet thou dost destroy
remember beseech thee thou hast made clay wilt bring dust again
hast thou poured out milk curdled like cheese
thou hast clothed skin flesh fenced bones sinews
thou hast granted life favour thy visitation hath preserved spirit
these things hast thou hid thine heart know thee
if sin then thou markest wilt acquit mine iniquity
if wicked woe righteous yet lift head am full confusion therefore see thou mine affliction
increaseth thou huntest fierce lion again shewest thyself marvellous upon
thou renewest thy witnesses against increasest thine indignation upon changes war
wherefore then hast thou brought forth out womb oh had given ghost no eye seen
should been though had carried womb grave
days few cease then let alone may take comfort little
before go whence return even land darkness shadow death
land darkness itself shadow death without any order where light
then answered zophar naamathite said
should multitude words answered man full talk justified
should thy lies make men hold peace thou mockest no man thee ashamed
thou hast said doctrine pure am clean thine eyes
oh god would speak open lips against thee
would shew thee secrets wisdom double know therefore god exacteth less than thine iniquity deserveth
canst thou by searching find out god almighty perfection
high heaven what canst thou do deeper than hell know
measure thereof longer than earth broader sea
if cut off shut or gather together then who can hinder
knoweth vain men seeth wickedness also then consider
vain man would wise though born like wild ass's colt
if thou prepare thine heart stretch out hands toward
if iniquity thine hand put far away let wickedness dwell thy tabernacles
then shalt thou lift thy face without spot yea stedfast fear
because thou shalt forget thy misery remember waters pass away
thine age clearer than noonday thou shalt shine forth morning
thou shalt secure because there hope yea dig about thee take thy rest safety
also thou shalt lie down none make thee afraid yea many suit
eyes wicked fail escape hope giving ghost
job answered said
no doubt ye people wisdom die you
understanding well you am inferior yea who knoweth such things these
am one mocked neighbour who calleth upon god answereth just upright man laughed scorn
ready slip feet lamp despised thought at ease
tabernacles robbers prosper provoke god secure whose hand bringeth abundantly
ask now beasts teach thee fowls air tell
or speak earth teach thee fishes sea declare
who knoweth these hand lord hath wrought
whose hand soul every living thing breath mankind
doth ear try words mouth taste meat
ancient wisdom length days understanding
wisdom strength hath counsel understanding
behold breaketh down cannot built again shutteth man there can no opening
behold withholdeth waters dry also sendeth out overturn earth
strength wisdom deceived deceiver
leadeth counsellors away spoiled maketh judges fools
looseth bond kings girdeth loins girdle
leadeth princes away spoiled overthroweth mighty
removeth away speech trusty taketh understanding aged
poureth contempt upon princes weakeneth strength mighty
discovereth deep things out darkness bringeth light shadow death
increaseth nations destroyeth enlargeth straiteneth again
taketh away heart chief people earth causeth wander wilderness where there no way
grope dark without light maketh stagger like drunken man
lo mine eye hath seen ear heard understood
what ye know same do also am inferior you
surely would speak almighty desire reason god
ye forgers lies physicians no value
o ye would altogether hold your peace should wisdom
hear now reasoning hearken pleadings lips
ye speak wickedly god talk deceitfully
ye accept person contend god
good should search you out or one man mocketh another do ye so mock
surely reprove you if ye do secretly accept persons
excellency make you afraid dread fall upon
your remembrances like ashes bodies clay
hold your peace let alone may speak come on what
wherefore do take flesh teeth put life mine hand
though slay yet trust maintain mine own ways before
also salvation hypocrite come before
hear diligently speech declaration your ears
behold now ordered cause know justified
who plead now if hold tongue give ghost
only do two things then hide myself thee
withdraw thine hand far let thy dread make afraid
then call thou answer or let speak
how many mine iniquities sins make know transgression sin
wherefore hidest thou thy face holdest thine enemy
wilt thou break leaf driven fro pursue dry stubble
thou writest bitter things against makest possess iniquities youth
thou puttest feet also stocks lookest narrowly paths settest print upon heels
rotten thing consumeth garment moth eaten
man born woman few days full trouble
cometh forth like flower cut down fleeth also shadow continueth
dost thou open thine eyes upon such one bringest judgment thee
who can bring clean thing out unclean one
seeing days determined number months thee thou hast appointed bounds cannot pass
turn may rest till accomplish hireling day
there hope tree if cut down sprout again tender branch thereof cease
though root thereof wax old earth stock die ground
yet through scent water bud bring forth boughs like plant
man dieth wasteth away yea giveth ghost where
waters fail sea flood decayeth drieth
so man lieth down riseth till heavens no more awake nor raised out sleep
o thou wouldest hide grave keep secret until thy wrath past appoint set time remember
if man die live again days appointed time wait till change come
thou shalt call answer thee wilt desire work thine hands
now thou numberest steps dost watch over sin
transgression sealed bag thou sewest mine iniquity
surely mountain falling cometh nought rock removed out place
waters wear stones thou washest away things grow out dust earth destroyest hope man
thou prevailest ever against passeth changest countenance sendest away
sons come honour knoweth brought low perceiveth
flesh upon pain soul within mourn
then answered eliphaz temanite said
should wise man utter vain knowledge fill belly east wind
should reason unprofitable talk or speeches wherewith can do no good
yea thou castest off fear restrainest prayer before god
thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity thou choosest tongue crafty
thine own mouth condemneth thee yea lips testify against
art thou first man born or wast made before hills
hast thou heard secret god dost restrain wisdom thyself
what knowest thou we know understandest us
us both grayheaded very aged men much elder than thy father
consolations god small thee there any secret thing
why doth thine heart carry thee away what do thy eyes wink at
thou turnest thy spirit against god lettest such words go out mouth
what man should clean born woman righteous
behold putteth no trust saints yea heavens clean sight
how much more abominable filthy man drinketh iniquity like water
shew thee hear seen declare
wise men told fathers hid
whom alone earth given no stranger passed among
wicked man travaileth pain days number years hidden oppressor
dreadful sound ears prosperity destroyer come upon
believeth return out darkness waited sword
wandereth abroad bread saying where knoweth day darkness ready at hand
trouble anguish make afraid prevail against king ready battle
stretcheth out hand against god strengtheneth himself almighty
runneth upon even on neck thick bosses bucklers
because covereth face fatness maketh collops fat on flanks
dwelleth desolate cities houses no man inhabiteth ready become heaps
rich neither substance continue prolong perfection thereof upon earth
depart out darkness flame dry branches by breath mouth go away
let deceived trust vanity recompence
accomplished before time branch green
shake off unripe grape vine cast flower olive
congregation hypocrites desolate fire consume tabernacles bribery
conceive mischief bring forth vanity belly prepareth deceit
then job answered said
heard many such things miserable comforters ye
vain words end or what emboldeneth thee thou answerest
also could speak ye do if your soul soul's stead heap words against you shake mine head at
would strengthen you mouth moving lips should asswage your grief
though speak grief asswaged forbear what am eased
now hath made weary thou hast desolate company
thou hast filled wrinkles witness against leanness rising beareth face
teareth wrath who hateth gnasheth upon teeth mine enemy sharpeneth eyes
gaped upon mouth smitten cheek reproachfully gathered themselves together against
god hath delivered ungodly turned over hands wicked
at ease hath broken asunder also taken by neck shaken pieces set mark
archers compass round about cleaveth reins asunder doth spare poureth out gall upon ground
breaketh breach upon runneth like giant
sewed sackcloth upon skin defiled horn dust
face foul weeping on eyelids shadow death
any injustice mine hands also prayer pure
o earth cover thou blood let cry no place
also now behold witness heaven record on high
friends scorn mine eye poureth out tears god
o one might plead man god pleadeth neighbour
few years come then go way whence return
breath corrupt days extinct graves ready
there mockers doth mine eye continue provocation
lay down now put surety thee who strike hands
thou hast hid heart understanding therefore shalt exalt
speaketh flattery friends even eyes children fail
hath made also byword people aforetime tabret
mine eye also dim by reason sorrow members shadow
upright men astonied at innocent stir himself against hypocrite
righteous also hold on way hath clean hands stronger
you do ye return come now cannot find one wise man among
days past purposes broken off even thoughts heart
change night day light short because darkness
if wait grave mine house made bed darkness
said corruption thou art father worm mother sister
where now hope who see
go down bars pit our rest together dust
then answered bildad shuhite said
how long ere ye make end words mark afterwards we speak
wherefore we counted beasts reputed vile your sight
teareth himself anger earth forsaken thee rock removed out place
yea light wicked put out spark fire shine
light dark tabernacle candle put out
steps strength straitened own counsel cast down
cast net by own feet walketh upon snare
gin take by heel robber prevail against
snare laid ground trap way
terrors make afraid on every side drive feet
strength hungerbitten destruction ready at side
devour strength skin even firstborn death
confidence rooted out tabernacle bring king terrors
dwell tabernacle because none brimstone scattered upon habitation
roots dried beneath above branch cut off
remembrance perish earth no name street
driven light darkness chased out world
neither son nor nephew among people any remaining dwellings
come after astonied at day went before affrighted
surely such dwellings wicked place knoweth god
then job answered said
how long ye vex soul break pieces words
these ten times ye reproached ashamed make yourselves strange
indeed erred mine error remaineth myself
if indeed ye magnify yourselves against plead reproach
know now god hath overthrown compassed net
behold cry out wrong am heard aloud there no judgment
hath fenced way cannot pass set darkness paths
hath stripped glory taken crown head
hath destroyed on every side am gone mine hope removed like tree
hath also kindled wrath against counteth one enemies
troops come together raise way against encamp round about tabernacle
hath put brethren far mine acquaintance verily estranged
kinsfolk failed familiar friends forgotten
dwell mine house maids count stranger am alien sight
called servant gave no answer intreated mouth
breath strange wife though intreated children's sake mine own body
yea young children despised arose spake against
inward friends abhorred whom loved turned against
bone cleaveth skin flesh am escaped teeth
pity upon o ye friends hand god hath touched
why do ye persecute god satisfied flesh
oh words now written printed book
graven iron pen lead rock ever
know redeemer liveth stand at latter day upon earth
though after skin worms destroy body yet flesh see god
whom see myself mine eyes behold another though reins consumed within
ye should say why persecute we seeing root matter found
ye afraid sword wrath bringeth punishments may know there judgment
then answered zophar naamathite said
therefore do thoughts cause answer make haste
heard check reproach spirit understanding causeth answer
knowest thou old since man placed upon earth
triumphing wicked short joy hypocrite moment
though excellency mount heavens head reach clouds
yet perish ever like own dung seen say where
fly away dream found yea chased vision night
eye also saw see no more neither place any behold
children seek please poor hands restore goods
bones full sin youth lie down dust
though wickedness sweet mouth hide under tongue
though spare forsake keep still within mouth
yet meat bowels turned gall asps within
hath swallowed down riches vomit again god cast out belly
suck poison asps viper's tongue slay
see rivers floods brooks honey butter
laboured restore swallow down according substance restitution rejoice therein
because hath oppressed forsaken poor violently taken away house builded
surely feel quietness belly save desired
there none meat left therefore no man look goods
fulness sufficiency straits every hand wicked come upon
about fill belly god cast fury wrath upon rain while eating
flee iron weapon bow steel strike through
drawn cometh out body yea glittering sword gall terrors upon
darkness hid secret places fire blown consume go ill left tabernacle
heaven reveal iniquity earth rise against
increase house depart goods flow away day wrath
portion wicked man god heritage appointed by
job answered said
hear diligently speech let your consolations
suffer may speak after spoken mock on
complaint man if so why should spirit troubled
mark astonished lay your hand upon mouth
even remember am afraid trembling taketh hold on flesh
wherefore do wicked live become old yea mighty power
seed established sight offspring before eyes
houses safe fear neither rod god upon
bull gendereth faileth cow calveth casteth her calf
send forth little ones like flock children dance
take timbrel harp rejoice at sound organ
spend days wealth moment go down grave
therefore say god depart us we desire knowledge thy ways
what almighty we should serve profit if pray
lo good hand counsel wicked far
how oft candle wicked put out cometh destruction upon god distributeth sorrows anger
stubble before wind chaff storm carrieth away
god layeth iniquity children rewardeth know
eyes see destruction drink wrath almighty
what pleasure hath house after number months cut off midst
any teach god knowledge seeing judgeth those high
one dieth full strength being wholly at ease quiet
breasts full milk bones moistened marrow
another dieth bitterness soul never eateth pleasure
lie down alike dust worms cover
behold know your thoughts devices ye wrongfully imagine against
ye say where house prince dwelling places wicked
ye asked go by way do know tokens
wicked reserved day destruction brought forth wrath
who declare way face repay what hath done
yet brought grave remain tomb
clods valley sweet every man draw after there innumerable before
how then comfort ye vain seeing your answers there remaineth falsehood
then eliphaz temanite answered said
can man profitable god wise may himself
any pleasure almighty thou art righteous or gain makest thy ways perfect
reprove thee fear enter judgment
thy wickedness great thine iniquities infinite
thou hast taken pledge thy brother nought stripped naked clothing
thou hast given water weary drink withholden bread hungry
mighty man had earth honourable dwelt
thou hast sent widows away empty arms fatherless been broken
therefore snares round about thee sudden fear troubleth
or darkness thou canst see abundance waters cover thee
god height heaven behold stars how high
thou sayest how doth god know can judge through dark cloud
thick clouds covering seeth walketh circuit heaven
hast thou marked old way wicked men trodden
cut down out time whose foundation overflown flood
said god depart us what can almighty do
yet filled houses good things counsel wicked far
righteous see glad innocent laugh scorn
whereas our substance cut down remnant fire consumeth
acquaint now thyself at peace thereby good come thee
receive pray thee law mouth lay words thine heart
if thou return almighty shalt built put away iniquity far thy tabernacles
then shalt thou lay gold dust ophir stones brooks
yea almighty thy defence thou shalt plenty silver
then shalt thou thy delight almighty lift face god
thou shalt make thy prayer hear thee pay vows
thou shalt also decree thing established thee light shine upon thy ways
men cast down then thou shalt say there lifting save humble person
deliver island innocent delivered by pureness thine hands
then job answered said
even day complaint bitter stroke heavier than groaning
oh knew where might find come even seat
would order cause before fill mouth arguments
would know words answer understand what say
plead against great power no would put strength
there righteous might dispute so should delivered ever judge
behold go forward there backward cannot perceive
on left hand where doth work cannot behold hideth himself right see
knoweth way take hath tried come forth gold
foot hath held steps way kept declined
neither gone back commandment lips esteemed words mouth more than necessary food
one mind who can turn what soul desireth even doeth
performeth thing appointed many such things
therefore am troubled at presence consider afraid
god maketh heart soft almighty troubleth
because cut off before darkness neither hath covered face
why seeing times hidden almighty do know see days
some remove landmarks violently take away flocks feed thereof
drive away ass fatherless take widow's ox pledge
turn needy out way poor earth hide themselves together
behold wild asses desert go forth work rising betimes prey wilderness yieldeth food children
reap every one corn field gather vintage wicked
cause naked lodge without clothing no covering cold
wet showers mountains embrace rock want shelter
pluck fatherless breast take pledge poor
cause go naked without clothing take away sheaf hungry
make oil within walls tread winepresses suffer thirst
men groan out city soul wounded crieth yet god layeth folly
those rebel against light know ways thereof nor abide paths
murderer rising light killeth poor needy night thief
eye also adulterer waiteth twilight saying no see disguiseth face
dark dig through houses had marked themselves daytime know light
morning even shadow death if one know terrors
swift waters portion cursed earth beholdeth way vineyards
drought heat consume snow waters so doth grave those sinned
womb forget worm feed sweetly on no more remembered wickedness broken tree
evil entreateth barren beareth doeth good widow
draweth also mighty power riseth no man sure life
though given safety whereon resteth yet eyes upon ways
exalted little while gone brought low taken out way other cut off tops ears corn
if so now who make liar speech nothing worth
then answered bildad shuhite said
dominion fear maketh peace high places
there any number armies upon whom doth light arise
how then can man justified god or clean born woman
behold even moon shineth yea stars pure sight
how much less man worm son
job answered said
how hast thou helped without power savest arm hath no strength
how hast thou counselled hath no wisdom plentifully declared thing
whom hast thou uttered words whose spirit came thee
dead things formed under waters inhabitants thereof
hell naked before destruction hath no covering
stretcheth out north over empty place hangeth earth upon nothing
bindeth waters thick clouds cloud rent under
holdeth back face throne spreadeth cloud upon
hath compassed waters bounds until day night come end
pillars heaven tremble astonished at reproof
divideth sea power by understanding smiteth through proud
by spirit hath garnished heavens hand formed crooked serpent
lo these parts ways how little portion heard thunder power who can understand

behold ye yourselves seen why then thus altogether vain
portion wicked man god heritage oppressors receive almighty
if children multiplied sword offspring satisfied bread

though heap silver dust prepare raiment clay

buildeth house moth booth keeper maketh
rich man lie down gathered openeth eyes
terrors take hold on waters tempest stealeth away night
east wind carrieth away departeth storm hurleth out place
god cast upon spare would fain flee out hand
men clap hands at hiss out place
surely there vein silver place gold where fine
iron taken out earth brass molten stone

flood breaketh out inhabitant even waters forgotten foot dried gone away men
earth out cometh bread under turned fire

there path no fowl knoweth vulture's eye hath seen
lion's whelps trodden nor fierce lion passed by
putteth forth hand upon rock overturneth mountains by roots
cutteth out rivers among rocks eye seeth every precious thing
bindeth floods overflowing thing hid bringeth forth light
where wisdom found place understanding
man knoweth price thereof neither found land living
depth saith sea
cannot gotten gold neither silver weighed price thereof
cannot valued gold ophir precious onyx or sapphire
gold crystal cannot equal exchange jewels fine
no mention made coral or pearls price wisdom above rubies
topaz ethiopia equal neither valued pure gold
whence then cometh wisdom where place understanding
seeing hid eyes living kept close fowls air
destruction death say we heard fame thereof our ears
god understandeth way thereof knoweth place

then did see declare prepared yea searched out
man said behold fear lord wisdom depart evil understanding
moreover job continued parable said
oh months past days god preserved
candle shined upon head by light walked through darkness
days youth secret god upon tabernacle

washed steps butter rock poured out rivers oil
went out gate through city prepared seat street
young men saw hid themselves aged arose stood
princes refrained talking laid hand on mouth
nobles held peace tongue cleaved roof mouth
ear heard then blessed eye saw gave witness
because delivered poor cried fatherless had none help
blessing ready perish came upon caused widow's heart sing joy
put on righteousness clothed judgment robe diadem
eyes blind feet lame
father poor cause knew searched out
brake jaws wicked plucked spoil out teeth
then said die nest multiply days sand
root spread out by waters dew lay night upon branch
glory fresh bow renewed hand
men gave ear waited kept silence at counsel
after words spake again speech dropped upon
waited rain opened mouth wide latter
if laughed on believed light countenance cast down
chose out way sat chief dwelt king army one comforteth mourners
now younger than derision whose fathers would disdained set dogs flock
yea whereto might strength hands profit whom old age perished
want famine solitary fleeing wilderness former time desolate waste
who cut mallows by bushes juniper roots meat
driven forth among men cried after thief
dwell clifts valleys caves earth rocks
among bushes brayed under nettles gathered together
children fools yea base men viler than earth
now am song yea byword
abhor flee far spare spit face
because hath loosed cord afflicted also let loose bridle before
upon right hand rise youth push away feet raise against ways destruction
mar path set forward calamity no helper
came upon wide breaking waters desolation rolled themselves
terrors turned upon pursue soul wind welfare passeth away cloud
now soul poured out upon days affliction taken hold
bones pierced night season sinews take no rest
by great force disease garment changed bindeth about collar coat
hath cast mire am become like dust ashes
cry thee thou dost hear stand regardest
thou art become cruel thy strong hand opposest thyself against
thou liftest wind causest ride upon dissolvest substance
know thou wilt bring death house appointed living
howbeit stretch out hand grave though cry destruction
did weep trouble soul grieved poor
looked good then evil came waited light there darkness
bowels boiled rested days affliction prevented
went mourning without sun stood cried congregation
am brother dragons companion owls
skin black upon bones burned heat
harp also turned mourning organ voice weep
made covenant mine eyes why then should think upon maid
what portion god there above inheritance almighty on high
destruction wicked strange punishment workers iniquity
doth see ways count steps
if walked vanity or foot hath hasted deceit
let weighed even balance god may know mine integrity
if step hath turned out way mine heart walked after eyes any blot cleaved hands
then let sow another eat yea offspring rooted out
if mine heart been deceived by woman or laid wait at neighbour's door
then let wife grind another others bow down upon her
heinous crime yea iniquity punished by judges
fire consumeth destruction would root out mine increase
if did despise cause manservant or maidservant contended
what then do god riseth visiteth answer
did made womb make one fashion us
if withheld poor desire or caused eyes widow fail
or eaten morsel myself alone fatherless hath thereof
youth brought father guided her mother's womb
if seen any perish want clothing or poor without covering
if loins blessed warmed fleece sheep
if lifted hand against fatherless saw help gate
then let mine arm fall shoulder blade broken bone
destruction god terror by reason highness could endure
if made gold hope or said fine thou art confidence
if rejoiced because wealth great mine hand had gotten much
if beheld sun shined or moon walking brightness
heart hath been secretly enticed or mouth kissed hand
also iniquity punished by judge should denied god above
if rejoiced at destruction hated or lifted myself evil found
neither suffered mouth sin by wishing curse soul
if men tabernacle said oh we had flesh cannot satisfied
stranger did lodge street opened doors traveller
if covered transgressions adam by hiding mine iniquity bosom
did fear great multitude or contempt families terrify kept silence went out door
oh one would hear behold desire almighty answer mine adversary had written book
surely would take upon shoulder bind crown
would declare number steps prince go near
if land cry against or furrows likewise thereof complain
if eaten fruits thereof without money or caused owners lose life
let thistles grow instead wheat cockle barley words job ended
so these three men ceased answer job because righteous own eyes
then kindled wrath elihu son barachel buzite kindred ram against job because justified himself rather than god
also against three friends wrath kindled because had found no answer yet condemned job
now elihu had waited till job spoken because elder than
elihu saw there no answer mouth these three men then wrath kindled
elihu son barachel buzite answered said am young ye very old wherefore afraid durst shew you mine opinion
said days should speak multitude years teach wisdom
there spirit man inspiration almighty giveth understanding
great men always wise neither do aged understand judgment
therefore said hearken also shew mine opinion
behold waited your words gave ear reasons whilst ye searched out what say
yea attended you behold there none convinced job or answered words
lest ye should say we found out wisdom god thrusteth down man
now hath directed words against neither answer your speeches
amazed answered no more left off speaking
had waited spake stood still answered no more
said answer also part shew mine opinion
am full matter spirit within constraineth
behold belly wine hath no vent ready burst like new bottles
speak may refreshed open lips answer
let pray you accept any man's person neither give flattering titles man
know give flattering titles so doing maker would soon take away
wherefore job pray thee hear speeches hearken words
behold now opened mouth tongue hath spoken
words uprightness heart lips utter knowledge clearly
spirit god hath made breath almighty given life
if thou canst answer set thy words order before stand
behold am according thy wish god's stead also formed out clay
behold terror make thee afraid neither hand heavy upon
surely thou hast spoken mine hearing heard voice thy words saying
am clean without transgression innocent neither there iniquity
behold findeth occasions against counteth enemy
putteth feet stocks marketh paths
behold thou art just answer thee god greater than man
why dost thou strive against giveth account any matters
god speaketh once yea twice yet man perceiveth
dream vision night deep sleep falleth upon men slumberings bed
then openeth ears men sealeth instruction
may withdraw man purpose hide pride
keepeth back soul pit life perishing by sword
chastened also pain upon bed multitude bones strong
so life abhorreth bread soul dainty meat
flesh consumed away cannot seen bones stick out
yea soul draweth near grave life destroyers
if there messenger interpreter one among thousand shew man uprightness
then gracious saith deliver going down pit found ransom
flesh fresher than child's return days youth
pray god favourable see face joy render man righteousness
looketh upon men if any say sinned perverted right profited
deliver soul going pit life see light
lo these things worketh god oftentimes man
bring back soul pit enlightened light living
mark well o job hearken hold thy peace speak
if thou hast any thing say answer speak desire justify thee
if hearken hold thy peace teach thee wisdom
furthermore elihu answered said
hear words o ye wise men give ear knowledge
ear trieth words mouth tasteth meat
let us choose judgment know among ourselves what good
job hath said am righteous god taken away judgment
should lie against right wound incurable without transgression
what man like job who drinketh scorning water
goeth company workers iniquity walketh wicked men
hath said profiteth man nothing should delight himself god
therefore hearken ye men understanding far god should do wickedness almighty commit iniquity
work man render cause every find according ways
yea surely god do wickedly neither almighty pervert judgment
who hath given charge over earth or disposed whole world
if set heart upon man gather himself spirit breath
flesh perish together man turn again dust
if now thou hast understanding hear hearken voice words
even hateth right govern wilt thou condemn most just
fit say king thou art wicked princes ye ungodly
how much less accepteth persons princes nor regardeth rich more than poor work hands
moment die people troubled at midnight pass away mighty taken without hand
eyes upon ways man seeth goings
there no darkness nor shadow death where workers iniquity may hide themselves
lay upon man more than right should enter judgment god
break pieces mighty men without number set others stead
therefore knoweth works overturneth night so destroyed
striketh wicked men open sight others
because turned back would consider any ways
so cause cry poor come heareth afflicted
giveth quietness who then can make trouble hideth face behold whether done against nation or man only
hypocrite reign lest people ensnared
surely meet said god borne chastisement offend any more
see teach thou if done iniquity do no more
should according thy mind recompense whether thou refuse or choose therefore speak what knowest
let men understanding tell wise man hearken
job hath spoken without knowledge words wisdom
desire job may tried end because answers wicked men
addeth rebellion sin clappeth hands among us multiplieth words against god
elihu spake moreover said
thinkest thou right saidst righteousness more than god's
thou saidst what advantage thee profit if cleansed sin
answer thee thy companions
look heavens see behold clouds higher than thou
if thou sinnest what doest against or thy transgressions multiplied
if thou righteous what givest or receiveth thine hand
thy wickedness may hurt man thou art righteousness profit son
by reason multitude oppressions make oppressed cry out arm mighty
none saith where god maker who giveth songs night
who teacheth us more than beasts earth maketh wiser fowls heaven
there cry none giveth answer because pride evil men
surely god hear vanity neither almighty regard
although thou sayest shalt see yet judgment before therefore trust
now because so hath visited anger yet knoweth great extremity
therefore doth job open mouth vain multiplieth words without knowledge
elihu also proceeded said
suffer little shew thee yet speak on god's behalf
fetch knowledge afar ascribe righteousness maker
truly words false perfect knowledge thee
behold god mighty despiseth any strength wisdom
preserveth life wicked giveth right poor
withdraweth eyes righteous kings on throne yea doth establish ever exalted
if bound fetters holden cords affliction
then sheweth work transgressions exceeded
openeth also ear discipline commandeth return iniquity
if obey serve spend days prosperity years pleasures
if obey perish by sword die without knowledge
hypocrites heart heap wrath cry bindeth
die youth life among unclean
delivereth poor affliction openeth ears oppression
even so would removed thee out strait broad place where there no straitness should set on thy table full fatness
thou hast fulfilled judgment wicked justice take hold on thee
because there wrath beware lest take thee away stroke then great ransom cannot deliver
esteem thy riches no gold nor forces strength
desire night people cut off place
take heed regard iniquity hast thou chosen rather than affliction
behold god exalteth by power who teacheth like
who hath enjoined way or can say thou hast wrought iniquity
remember thou magnify work men behold
every man may see behold afar off
behold god great we know neither can number years searched out
maketh small drops water pour down rain according vapour thereof

noise thereof sheweth concerning cattle also vapour
at also heart trembleth moved out place
hear attentively noise voice sound goeth out mouth
directeth under whole heaven lightning ends earth
after voice roareth thundereth excellency stay heard
god thundereth marvellously voice great things doeth we cannot comprehend
saith snow thou on earth likewise small rain great strength
sealeth hand every man men may know work
then beasts go dens remain places
out south cometh whirlwind cold north
by breath god frost given breadth waters straitened
also by watering wearieth thick cloud scattereth bright
turned round about by counsels may do whatsoever commandeth upon face world earth
causeth come whether correction or land mercy
hearken o job stand still consider wondrous works god
dost thou know god disposed caused light cloud shine
dost thou know balancings clouds wondrous works perfect knowledge
how thy garments warm quieteth earth by south wind
hast thou spread out sky strong molten looking glass
teach us what we say cannot order our speech by reason darkness
told speak if man surely swallowed
now men see bright light clouds wind passeth cleanseth
fair weather cometh out north god terrible majesty
touching almighty we cannot find out excellent power judgment plenty justice afflict
men do therefore fear respecteth any wise heart
then lord answered job out whirlwind said
who darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge
gird now thy loins like man demand thee answer thou
where wast thou laid foundations earth declare if hast understanding
who hath laid measures thereof if thou knowest or stretched line upon
whereupon foundations thereof fastened or who laid corner stone

cause rain on earth where no man wilderness wherein there
satisfy desolate waste ground cause bud tender herb spring forth
hath rain father or who begotten drops dew
out whose womb came ice hoary frost heaven who hath gendered

canst thou bring forth mazzaroth season or guide arcturus sons
knowest thou ordinances heaven canst set dominion thereof earth
canst thou lift thy voice clouds abundance waters may cover thee
canst thou send lightnings may go say thee here we
who hath put wisdom inward parts or given understanding heart
who can number clouds wisdom or stay bottles heaven
dust groweth hardness clods cleave fast together
wilt thou hunt prey lion or fill appetite young lions
couch dens abide covert lie wait
who provideth raven food young ones cry god wander lack meat
knowest thou time wild goats rock bring forth or canst mark hinds do calve
canst thou number months fulfil or knowest time bring forth
bow themselves bring forth young ones cast out sorrows
young ones good liking grow corn go forth return
who hath sent out wild ass free or loosed bands
whose house made wilderness barren land dwellings
scorneth multitude city neither regardeth crying driver
range mountains pasture searcheth after every green thing
unicorn willing serve thee or abide by thy crib
canst thou bind unicorn band furrow or harrow valleys after thee
wilt thou trust because strength great or leave thy labour
wilt thou believe bring home thy seed gather barn
gavest thou goodly wings peacocks or feathers ostrich
leaveth her eggs earth warmeth dust
forgetteth foot may crush or wild beast break
she hardened against her young ones though hers labour vain without fear
because god hath deprived her wisdom neither imparted understanding
what time she lifteth herself on high scorneth horse rider
hast thou given horse strength clothed neck thunder
canst thou make afraid grasshopper glory nostrils terrible
paweth valley rejoiceth strength goeth on meet armed men
mocketh at fear affrighted neither turneth back sword
quiver rattleth against glittering spear shield
swalloweth ground fierceness rage neither believeth sound trumpet
saith among trumpets ha smelleth battle afar off thunder captains shouting
doth hawk fly by thy wisdom stretch her wings toward south
doth eagle mount at thy command make her nest on high
she dwelleth abideth on rock upon crag strong place
thence she seeketh prey her eyes behold afar off
her young ones also suck blood where slain there she
moreover lord answered job said

then job answered lord said

behold now behemoth made thee eateth grass ox

wilt thou play bird or bind thy maidens
companions make banquet part among merchants

lay thine hand upon remember battle do no more
behold hope vain one cast down even at sight
none so fierce dare stir who then able stand before
who hath prevented should repay whatsoever under whole heaven mine
conceal parts nor power comely proportion
who can discover face garment or come double bridle
who can open doors face teeth terrible round about
scales pride shut together close seal
one so near another no air can come between
joined one another stick together cannot sundered
by neesings light doth shine eyes like eyelids morning
out mouth go burning lamps sparks fire leap
out nostrils goeth smoke seething pot or caldron
breath kindleth coals flame goeth out mouth
neck remaineth strength sorrow turned joy before
flakes flesh joined together firm themselves cannot moved
heart firm stone yea hard piece nether millstone
raiseth himself mighty afraid by reason breakings purify themselves
sword layeth at cannot hold spear dart nor habergeon
esteemeth iron straw brass rotten wood
arrow cannot make flee slingstones turned stubble
darts counted stubble laugheth at shaking spear
sharp stones under spreadeth pointed things upon mire
maketh deep boil like pot sea ointment
maketh path shine after one would think deep hoary
upon earth there like who made without fear
beholdeth high things king over children pride
then job answered lord said

she openeth her mouth wisdom tongue law kindness
she looketh well ways her household eateth bread idleness
her children arise call blessed husband also praiseth
many daughters done virtuously thou excellest
favour deceitful beauty vain woman feareth lord she praised
give her fruit hands let own works praise gates
words preacher son david king jerusalem
vanity vanities saith preacher
what profit hath man labour taketh under sun
one generation passeth away another cometh earth abideth ever
sun also ariseth goeth down hasteth place where arose
wind goeth toward south turneth about north whirleth continually returneth again according circuits
rivers run sea yet full place whence come thither return again
things full labour man cannot utter eye satisfied seeing nor ear filled hearing
thing hath been done there no new under sun
there any thing whereof may said see new hath been already old time before us
there no remembrance former things neither any come those after
preacher king over israel jerusalem
gave heart seek search out by wisdom concerning things done under heaven sore travail hath god given sons man exercised therewith
seen works done under sun behold vanity vexation spirit
crooked cannot made straight wanting numbered
communed mine own heart saying lo am come great estate gotten more wisdom than been before jerusalem yea had experience knowledge
gave heart know wisdom madness folly perceived also vexation spirit
much wisdom grief increaseth knowledge sorrow
said mine heart go now prove thee mirth therefore enjoy pleasure behold also vanity
said laughter mad mirth what doeth
sought mine heart give myself wine yet acquainting wisdom lay hold on folly till might see what good sons men should do under heaven days life
made great works builded houses planted vineyards
made gardens orchards planted trees kind fruits
made pools water therewith wood bringeth forth trees
got servants maidens had born house also great possessions small cattle above jerusalem before
gathered also silver gold peculiar treasure kings provinces gat men singers women delights sons musical instruments sorts
so great increased more than before jerusalem also wisdom remained
whatsoever mine eyes desired kept withheld heart any joy rejoiced labour portion
then looked on works hands had wrought labour laboured do behold vanity vexation spirit there no profit under sun
turned myself behold wisdom madness folly what can man do cometh after king even hath been already done
then saw wisdom excelleth folly far light darkness
wise man's eyes head fool walketh darkness myself perceived also one event happeneth
then said heart happeneth fool so even why more wise also vanity
there no remembrance wise more than fool ever seeing now days come forgotten how dieth man
therefore hated life because work wrought under sun grievous vanity vexation spirit
yea hated labour had taken under sun because should leave man after
who knoweth whether wise man or fool yet rule over labour wherein laboured shewed myself under sun also vanity
therefore went about cause heart despair labour took under sun
there man whose labour wisdom knowledge equity yet hath laboured therein leave portion also vanity great evil
what hath man labour vexation heart wherein laboured under sun
days sorrows travail grief yea heart taketh rest night also vanity
there nothing better man than should eat drink make soul enjoy good labour also saw hand god
who can eat or else hasten hereunto more than
god giveth man good sight wisdom knowledge joy sinner travail gather heap may give before also vanity vexation spirit
every thing there season time purpose under heaven
time born die plant pluck planted
time kill heal break down build
time weep laugh mourn dance
time cast away stones gather together embrace refrain embracing
time get lose keep cast away
time rend sew keep silence speak
time love hate war peace
what profit hath worketh wherein laboureth
seen travail god hath given sons men exercised
hath made every thing beautiful time also set world heart so no man can find out work god maketh beginning end
know there no good man rejoice do life
also every man should eat drink enjoy good labour gift god
know whatsoever god doeth ever nothing can put nor any thing taken men should fear before
hath been now already god requireth past
moreover saw under sun place judgment wickedness there righteousness iniquity
said mine heart god judge righteous wicked there time every purpose work
said mine heart concerning estate sons men god might manifest see themselves beasts
befalleth sons men beasts even one thing dieth so other yea breath man hath no preeminence above beast vanity
go one place dust turn again
who knoweth spirit man goeth upward beast downward earth
wherefore perceive there nothing better than man should rejoice own works portion who bring see what after
so returned considered oppressions done under sun behold tears such oppressed had no comforter on side oppressors there power
wherefore praised dead already more than living yet alive
yea better than both hath yet been who seen evil work done under sun
again considered travail every right work man envied neighbour also vanity vexation spirit
fool foldeth hands together eateth own flesh
better handful quietness than both hands full travail vexation spirit
then returned saw vanity under sun
there one alone second yea hath neither child nor brother yet no end labour eye satisfied riches saith whom do bereave soul good also vanity sore travail
two better than one because good reward labour
if fall one lift fellow woe alone falleth hath another help
again if two lie together then heat how can one warm alone
if one prevail against two withstand threefold cord quickly broken
better poor wise child than old foolish king who no more admonished
out prison cometh reign whereas also born kingdom becometh poor
considered living walk under sun second child stand stead
there no end people even been before also come after rejoice surely vanity vexation spirit
keep thy foot thou goest house god more ready hear than give sacrifice fools consider do evil
rash thy mouth let thine heart hasty utter any thing before god heaven thou upon earth therefore words few
dream cometh through multitude business fool's voice known by words
thou vowest vow god defer pay hath no pleasure fools hast vowed
better thou shouldest vow than pay
suffer thy mouth cause flesh sin neither say thou before angel error wherefore should god angry at voice destroy work thine hands
multitude dreams many words there also divers vanities fear thou god
if thou seest oppression poor violent perverting judgment justice province marvel at matter higher than highest regardeth there
moreover profit earth king himself served by field
loveth silver satisfied nor abundance increase also vanity
goods increase increased eat what good there owners thereof saving beholding eyes
sleep labouring man sweet whether eat little or much abundance rich suffer
there sore evil seen under sun namely riches kept owners thereof hurt
those riches perish by evil travail begetteth son there nothing hand
came forth mother's womb naked return go take nothing labour may carry away hand
also sore evil points came so go what profit hath laboured wind
days also eateth darkness hath much sorrow wrath sickness
behold seen good comely one eat drink enjoy labour taketh under sun days life god giveth portion
every man also whom god hath given riches wealth power eat thereof take portion rejoice labour gift
much remember days life because god answereth joy heart
there evil seen under sun common among men
man whom god hath given riches wealth honour so wanteth nothing soul desireth yet giveth power eat thereof stranger eateth vanity evil disease
if man beget hundred children live many years so days soul filled good also no burial say untimely birth better than
cometh vanity departeth darkness name covered
moreover hath seen sun nor known any thing more rest than other
yea though live thousand years twice told yet hath seen no good do go one place
labour man mouth yet appetite filled
what hath wise more than fool poor knoweth walk before living
better sight eyes than wandering desire also vanity vexation spirit
hath been named already known man neither may contend mightier than
seeing there many things increase vanity what man better
who knoweth what good man life days vain spendeth shadow can tell after under sun
good name better than precious ointment day death one's birth
better go house mourning than feasting end men living lay heart
sorrow better than laughter by sadness countenance heart made
heart wise house mourning fools mirth
better hear rebuke wise than man song fools
crackling thorns under pot so laughter fool also vanity
surely oppression maketh wise man mad gift destroyeth heart
better end thing than beginning thereof patient spirit proud
hasty thy spirit angry anger resteth bosom fools
say thou what cause former days better than these dost enquire wisely concerning
wisdom good inheritance by there profit see sun
wisdom defence money excellency knowledge giveth life
consider work god who can make straight hath made crooked
day prosperity joyful adversity consider god also hath set one over against other end man should find nothing after
things seen days vanity there just man perisheth righteousness wicked prolongeth life wickedness
righteous over much neither make thyself wise why shouldest thou destroy
over much wicked neither thou foolish why shouldest die before thy time
good thou shouldest take hold yea also withdraw thine hand feareth god come forth
wisdom strengtheneth wise more than ten mighty men city
there just man upon earth doeth good sinneth
also take no heed words spoken lest thou hear thy servant curse thee
oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth thou thyself likewise hast cursed others
proved by wisdom said wise far
far off exceeding deep who can find out
applied mine heart know search seek out wisdom reason things wickedness folly even foolishness madness
find more bitter than death woman whose heart snares nets her hands bands whoso pleaseth god escape sinner taken by
behold found saith preacher counting one by find out account
yet soul seeketh find one man among thousand found woman those
lo only found god hath made man upright sought out many inventions
who wise man knoweth interpretation thing man's wisdom maketh face shine boldness changed
counsel thee keep king's commandment regard oath god
hasty go out sight stand evil thing doeth whatsoever pleaseth
where word king there power who may say what doest thou
whoso keepeth commandment feel no evil thing wise man's heart discerneth both time judgment
because every purpose there time judgment therefore misery man great upon
knoweth who can tell
there no man hath power over spirit retain neither day death discharge war wickedness deliver those given
seen applied heart every work done under sun there time wherein one man ruleth over another own hurt
so saw wicked buried who had come gone place holy forgotten city where done also vanity
because sentence against evil work executed speedily therefore heart sons men fully set do
though sinner do evil hundred times days prolonged yet surely know well fear god before
well wicked neither prolong days shadow because feareth before god
there vanity done upon earth just men whom happeneth according work wicked again righteous said also
then commended mirth because man hath no better thing under sun than eat drink merry abide labour days life god giveth
applied mine heart know wisdom see business done upon earth also there neither day nor night seeth sleep eyes
then beheld work god man cannot find out done under sun because though labour seek yet yea further wise think know able
considered heart even declare righteous wise works hand god no man knoweth either love or hatred by before
things come alike there one event righteous wicked good clean unclean sacrificeth so sinner sweareth feareth oath
evil among things done under sun there one event yea also heart sons men full madness while live after go dead
joined living there hope dog better than dead lion
living know die dead any thing neither more reward memory forgotten
also love hatred envy now perished neither any more portion ever thing done under sun
go thy way eat bread joy drink wine merry heart god now accepteth works
let thy garments always white head lack no ointment
live joyfully wife whom thou lovest days life thy vanity hath given thee under sun portion labour takest
whatsoever thy hand findeth do might there no work nor device knowledge wisdom grave whither thou goest
returned saw under sun race swift nor battle strong neither yet bread wise riches men understanding favour skill time chance happeneth
man also knoweth time fishes taken evil net birds caught snare so sons men snared falleth suddenly upon
wisdom seen also under sun seemed great
there little city few men within came great king against besieged built bulwarks
now there found poor wise man by wisdom delivered city yet no remembered same
then said wisdom better than strength nevertheless poor man's despised words heard
words wise men heard quiet more than cry ruleth among fools
wisdom better than weapons war one sinner destroyeth much good
dead flies cause ointment apothecary send forth stinking savour so doth little folly reputation wisdom honour
wise man's heart at right hand fool's left
yea also fool walketh by way wisdom faileth saith every one
if spirit ruler rise against thee leave thy place yielding pacifieth great offences
there evil seen under sun error proceedeth ruler
folly set great dignity rich sit low place
seen servants upon horses princes walking earth
diggeth pit fall whoso breaketh hedge serpent bite
whoso removeth stones hurt therewith cleaveth wood endangered thereby
if iron blunt do whet edge then must put more strength wisdom profitable direct
surely serpent bite without enchantment babbler no better
words wise man's mouth gracious lips fool swallow himself
beginning words mouth foolishness end talk mischievous madness
fool also full words man cannot tell what after who can
labour foolish wearieth every one because knoweth how go city
woe thee o land thy king child princes eat morning
blessed art thou o land thy king son nobles princes eat due season strength drunkenness
by much slothfulness building decayeth through idleness hands house droppeth
feast made laughter wine maketh merry money answereth things
curse king no thy thought rich bedchamber bird air carry voice hath wings tell matter
cast thy bread upon waters thou shalt find after many days
give portion seven also eight thou knowest what evil upon earth
if clouds full rain empty themselves upon earth tree fall toward south or north place where falleth there
observeth wind sow regardeth clouds reap
thou knowest what way spirit nor how bones do grow womb her child even so works god who maketh
morning sow thy seed evening withhold thine hand thou knowest whether prosper either or both alike good
truly light sweet pleasant thing eyes behold sun
if man live many years rejoice yet let remember days darkness cometh vanity
rejoice o young man thy youth let heart cheer thee days walk ways thine sight eyes know thou these things god bring judgment
therefore remove sorrow thy heart put away evil flesh childhood youth vanity
remember now thy creator days youth while evil come nor years draw nigh thou shalt say no pleasure
while sun or light moon stars darkened nor clouds return after rain
day keepers house tremble strong men bow themselves grinders cease because few those look out windows darkened
doors shut streets sound grinding low rise at voice bird daughters musick brought
also afraid high fears way almond tree flourish grasshopper burden desire fail because man goeth long home mourners go about streets
or ever silver cord loosed golden bowl broken pitcher at fountain wheel cistern
then dust return earth spirit god who gave
vanity vanities saith preacher
moreover because preacher wise still taught people knowledge yea gave good heed sought out set order many proverbs
preacher sought find out acceptable words written upright even truth
words wise goads nails fastened by masters assemblies given one shepherd
further by these son admonished making many books there no end much study weariness flesh
let us hear conclusion whole matter fear god keep commandments duty man
god bring every work judgment secret thing whether good or evil

thus do place saith lord inhabitants thereof even make city tophet
houses jerusalem kings judah defiled place tophet because upon whose roofs burned incense host heaven poured out drink offerings other gods
then came jeremiah tophet whither lord had sent prophesy stood court lord's house said people
thus saith lord hosts god israel behold bring upon city her towns evil pronounced against because hardened necks might hear words
now pashur son immer priest who also chief governor house lord heard jeremiah prophesied these things

if ye do thing indeed then there enter by gates house kings sitting upon throne david riding chariots on horses servants people
if ye hear these words swear by myself saith lord house become desolation
thus saith lord king's house judah thou art gilead head lebanon yet surely make thee wilderness cities inhabited
prepare destroyers against thee every one weapons cut down thy choice cedars cast fire
many nations pass by city say every man neighbour wherefore hath lord done thus great
then answer because forsaken covenant lord god worshipped other gods served

thus saith lord touching shallum son josiah king judah reigned instead father went forth out place return thither any more

woe buildeth house by unrighteousness chambers wrong useth neighbour's service without wages giveth work
saith build wide house large chambers cutteth out windows cieled cedar painted vermilion
shalt thou reign because closest thyself cedar did thy father eat drink do judgment justice then well

thine eyes heart thy covetousness shed innocent blood oppression violence do
therefore thus saith lord concerning jehoiakim son josiah king judah lament saying ah brother or sister glory

daniel fainted sick certain days afterward rose did king's business astonished at vision none understood
first year darius son ahasuerus seed medes made king over realm chaldeans
first year reign daniel understood by books number years whereof word lord came jeremiah prophet would accomplish seventy desolations jerusalem

third year cyrus king persia thing revealed daniel whose name called belteshazzar true time appointed long understood had understanding vision
those days daniel mourning three full weeks
ate no pleasant bread neither came flesh nor wine mouth did anoint myself at till three whole weeks fulfilled
four twentieth day first month by side great river hiddekel
then lifted mine eyes looked behold certain man clothed linen whose loins girded fine gold uphaz

daniel alone saw vision men great quaking fell upon so fled hide themselves
therefore left alone saw great vision there remained no strength comeliness turned corruption retained
yet heard voice words then deep sleep on face toward ground
behold hand touched set upon knees palms hands

hath ears hear let
whereunto liken generation like children sitting markets calling fellows
saying we piped you ye danced mourned lamented
john came neither eating nor drinking say hath devil
son man came eating drinking say behold gluttonous winebibber friend publicans sinners wisdom justified her children
then began upbraid cities wherein most mighty works done because repented
woe thee chorazin bethsaida if mighty works done you had been tyre sidon would repented long ago sackcloth ashes
say you more tolerable tyre sidon at day judgment than
thou capernaum art exalted heaven shalt brought down hell if mighty works been done thee had sodom would remained until day
say you more tolerable land sodom day judgment than thee
at time jesus answered said thank thee o father lord heaven earth because thou hast hid these things wise prudent revealed babes
even so father seemed good thy sight

come ye labour heavy laden give you rest
take yoke upon you learn am meek lowly heart ye find rest your souls
yoke easy burden light
at time jesus went on sabbath day through corn disciples hungred began pluck ears eat
pharisees saw said behold thy disciples do lawful upon sabbath day
said ye read what david did hungred
how entered house god did eat shewbread lawful neither only priests
or ye read law how on sabbath days priests temple profane blameless

said what man there among you one sheep if fall pit on sabbath day lay hold lift out
how much then man better than sheep wherefore lawful do well on sabbath days
then saith man stretch forth thine hand stretched restored whole like other
then pharisees went out held council against how might destroy
jesus knew withdrew himself thence great multitudes followed healed
charged should make known
might fulfilled spoken by esaias prophet saying
behold servant whom chosen beloved soul well pleased put spirit upon shew judgment gentiles
strive nor cry neither any man hear voice streets
bruised reed break smoking flax quench till send forth judgment victory
name gentiles trust
then brought one possessed devil blind dumb healed insomuch both spake saw
people amazed said son david
pharisees heard said fellow doth cast out devils by beelzebub prince
jesus knew thoughts said every kingdom divided against itself brought desolation city or house stand
if satan cast out divided against himself how then kingdom stand
if by beelzebub cast out devils whom do your children therefore judges
if cast out devils by spirit god then kingdom come you
or else how can one enter strong man's house spoil goods except first bind man then
against gathereth scattereth abroad
wherefore say you manner sin blasphemy forgiven men against holy ghost
whosoever speaketh word against son man forgiven holy ghost neither world come
either make tree good fruit or else corrupt known by
o generation vipers how can ye being evil speak good things out abundance heart mouth speaketh
good man out treasure heart bringeth forth things evil
say you every idle word men speak give account thereof day judgment
by thy words thou shalt justified condemned
then certain scribes pharisees answered saying master we would see sign thee
answered said evil adulterous generation seeketh after sign there no given prophet jonas
jonas three days nights whale's belly so son man heart earth
men nineveh rise judgment generation condemn because repented at preaching jonas behold greater than here
queen south rise judgment generation condemn she came uttermost parts earth hear wisdom solomon behold greater than here
unclean spirit gone out man walketh through dry places seeking rest findeth none
then saith return house whence came out come findeth empty swept garnished
then goeth taketh himself seven other spirits more wicked than enter dwell there last state man worse first even so also generation
while yet talked people behold mother brethren stood without desiring speak
then one said behold thy mother brethren stand without desiring speak thee
answered said told who mother brethren
stretched forth hand toward disciples said behold mother brethren
whosoever do father heaven same brother sister mother
same day went jesus out house sat by sea side
great multitudes gathered together so went ship sat whole multitude stood on shore
spake many things parables saying behold sower went forth sow
sowed some seeds fell by way side fowls came devoured
some fell upon stony places where had much earth forthwith sprung because no deepness
sun scorched because had no root withered away
some fell among thorns sprung choked
other fell good ground brought forth fruit some hundredfold sixtyfold thirtyfold
who hath ears hear let
disciples came said why speakest thou parables
answered said because given you know mysteries kingdom heaven
whosoever hath given more abundance taken away even
therefore speak parables because seeing see hearing hear neither do understand
fulfilled prophecy esaias saith by hearing ye hear understand seeing see perceive
people's heart waxed gross ears dull hearing eyes closed lest at any time should see hear understand converted heal
blessed your eyes see ears hear
verily say you many prophets righteous men desired see those things ye seen hear heard
hear ye therefore parable sower
any one heareth word kingdom understandeth then cometh wicked catcheth away sown heart received seed by way side
received seed stony places same heareth word anon joy receiveth
yet hath root himself dureth while tribulation or persecution ariseth because word by offended
also received seed among thorns heareth word care world deceitfulness riches choke becometh unfruitful
received seed good ground heareth word understandeth also beareth fruit bringeth forth some hundredfold sixty thirty
another parable put forth saying kingdom heaven likened man sowed good seed field
while men slept enemy came sowed tares among wheat went way
blade sprung brought forth fruit then appeared tares also
so servants householder came said sir didst thou sow good seed thy field whence then hath tares
said enemy hath done servants wilt thou then we go gather
said nay lest while ye gather tares root also wheat
let both grow together until harvest time say reapers gather ye first tares bind bundles burn wheat barn
another parable put forth saying kingdom heaven like grain mustard seed man took sowed field
indeed least seeds grown greatest among herbs becometh tree so birds air come lodge branches thereof
another parable spake kingdom heaven like leaven woman took hid three measures meal till whole leavened
these things spake jesus multitude parables without parable
might fulfilled spoken by prophet saying open mouth parables utter things been kept secret foundation world
then jesus sent multitude away went house disciples came saying declare us parable tares field
answered said soweth good seed son man
field world good seed children kingdom tares wicked one
enemy sowed devil harvest end world reapers angels
therefore tares gathered burned fire so end world
son man send forth angels gather out kingdom things offend do iniquity
cast furnace fire there wailing gnashing teeth
then righteous shine forth sun kingdom father who hath ears hear let
again kingdom heaven like treasure hid field man hath found hideth joy thereof goeth selleth buyeth
again kingdom heaven like merchant man seeking goodly pearls
who had found one pearl great price went sold bought
again kingdom heaven like net cast sea gathered every kind
full drew shore sat down gathered good vessels cast bad away
so at end world angels come forth sever wicked among just
cast furnace fire there wailing gnashing teeth
jesus saith ye understood these things say yea lord
then said therefore every scribe instructed kingdom heaven like man householder bringeth forth out treasure things new old
came pass jesus had finished these parables departed thence

besought might only touch hem garment many touched made perfectly whole
then came jesus scribes pharisees jerusalem saying
why do thy disciples transgress tradition elders wash hands eat bread
answered said why do ye also transgress commandment god by your tradition
god commanded saying honour thy father mother curseth or let die death
ye say whosoever father or mother gift by whatsoever thou mightest profited
honour father or mother free thus ye made commandment god none effect by your tradition
ye hypocrites well did esaias prophesy you saying
people draweth nigh mouth honoureth lips heart far
vain do worship teaching doctrines commandments men
called multitude said hear understand
goeth mouth defileth man cometh out
then came disciples said knowest thou pharisees offended after heard saying
answered said every plant heavenly father hath planted rooted
let alone blind leaders if lead both fall ditch
then answered peter said declare us parable
jesus said ye also yet without understanding
do ye yet understand whatsoever entereth at mouth goeth belly cast out draught
those things proceed out mouth come forth heart defile man
out heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witness blasphemies
these things defile man eat unwashen hands defileth
then jesus went thence departed coasts tyre sidon

jesus departed thence came nigh sea galilee went mountain sat down there

then jesus called disciples said compassion on multitude because continue now three days nothing eat send away fasting lest faint way

wicked adulterous generation seeketh after sign there no given prophet jonas left departed
disciples come other side had forgotten take bread
then jesus said take heed beware leaven pharisees sadducees
reasoned among themselves saying because we taken no bread
jesus perceived said o ye little faith why reason among yourselves because brought no bread
do ye yet understand neither remember five loaves thousand how many baskets took
neither seven loaves four thousand how many baskets ye took
how ye do understand spake you concerning bread should beware leaven pharisees sadducees
then understood how bade beware leaven bread doctrine pharisees sadducees
jesus came coasts caesarea philippi asked disciples saying whom do men say son man am
said some say thou art john baptist elias others jeremias or one prophets
saith whom say ye am
simon peter answered said thou art christ son living god
jesus answered said blessed art thou simon barjona flesh blood hath revealed thee father heaven

verily say you there some standing here taste death till see son man coming kingdom
after six days jesus taketh peter james john brother bringeth high mountain apart
transfigured before face did shine sun raiment white light
behold there appeared moses elias talking

peter saith strangers jesus then children free
notwithstanding lest we should offend go thou sea cast hook take fish first cometh hast opened mouth shalt find piece money give thee
at same time came disciples jesus saying who greatest kingdom heaven
jesus called little child set midst
said verily say you except ye converted become little children enter kingdom heaven
whosoever therefore humble himself little child same greatest kingdom heaven
whoso receive one such little child name receiveth
whoso offend one these little ones believe better millstone hanged about neck drowned depth sea
woe world because offences must needs come man by whom offence cometh
wherefore if thy hand or foot offend thee cut off cast better enter life halt maimed rather than having two hands feet everlasting fire

disciples remembered written zeal thine house hath eaten
then answered jews said what sign shewest thou us seeing doest these things
jesus answered said destroy temple three days raise

saying what we do these men indeed notable miracle hath been done by manifest dwell jerusalem cannot deny
spread no further among people let us straitly threaten speak henceforth man name

man above forty years old on whom miracle healing shewed
being let go went own company reported chief priests elders had said
heard lifted voice god one accord said lord thou art hast made heaven earth sea

ananias hearing these words fell down gave ghost great fear came on heard things
young men arose wound carried out buried

peter answered her tell whether ye sold land so much she said yea
then peter said her how ye agreed together tempt spirit lord behold feet buried thy husband at door carry thee out
then fell she down straightway at feet yielded ghost young men came found her dead carrying forth buried by husband
great fear came upon church many heard these things
by hands apostles many signs wonders wrought among people one accord solomon's porch
rest durst no man join himself people magnified
believers more added lord multitudes both men women
insomuch brought forth sick streets laid on beds couches at least shadow peter passing by might overshadow some
there came also multitude out cities round about jerusalem bringing sick folks vexed unclean spirits healed every one
then high priest rose sect sadducees filled indignation

said ye men israel take heed yourselves what intend do touching these
before these days rose theudas boasting himself somebody whom number men about four hundred joined themselves who slain many obeyed scattered brought nought

if god ye cannot overthrow lest haply found even fight against
agreed had called apostles beaten commanded should speak name jesus let go
departed presence council rejoicing counted worthy suffer shame name
daily temple every house ceased teach preach jesus christ

then said paul god smite thee thou whited wall sittest judge after law commandest smitten contrary
stood by said revilest thou god's high priest
then said paul wist brethren high priest written thou shalt speak evil ruler thy people
paul perceived one part sadducees other pharisees cried out council men brethren am pharisee son hope resurrection dead called question
had so said there arose dissension between pharisees sadducees multitude divided
sadducees say there no resurrection neither angel nor spirit pharisees confess both
there arose great cry scribes pharisees' part strove saying we find no evil man if spirit or angel hath spoken let us fight against god
there arose great dissension chief captain fearing lest paul should been pulled pieces commanded soldiers go down take by force among bring castle
night following lord stood by said good cheer paul thou hast testified jerusalem so must bear witness also at rome
day certain jews banded together bound themselves under curse saying would neither eat nor drink till had killed paul
more than forty had made conspiracy
came chief priests elders said we bound ourselves under great curse eat nothing until slain paul
now therefore ye council signify chief captain bring down you morrow though would enquire something more perfectly concerning we or ever come near ready kill
paul's sister's son heard lying wait went entered castle told paul
then paul called one centurions said bring young man chief captain hath certain thing tell

then chief captain took by hand went aside privately asked what thou hast tell
said jews agreed desire thee thou wouldest bring down paul morrow council though would enquire somewhat more perfectly
do thou yield there lie wait more than forty men bound themselves oath neither eat nor drink till killed now ready looking promise thee
so chief captain then let young man depart charged see thou tell no hast shewed these things
called two centurions saying make ready hundred soldiers go caesarea horsemen threescore ten spearmen at third hour night
provide beasts may set paul on bring safe felix governor
wrote letter after manner
claudius lysias most excellent governor felix sendeth greeting

governor had read letter asked what province understood cilicia

after five days ananias high priest descended elders certain orator named tertullus who informed governor against paul
called forth tertullus began accuse saying seeing by thee we enjoy great quietness very worthy deeds done nation thy providence

notwithstanding further tedious thee pray thou wouldest hear us thy clemency few words
we found man pestilent fellow mover sedition among jews throughout world ringleader sect nazarenes
who also hath gone about profane temple whom we took would judged according our law
chief captain lysias came upon us great violence took away out our hands
commanding accusers come thee by examining whom thyself mayest take knowledge these things whereof we accuse
jews also assented saying these things so
then paul after governor had beckoned speak answered forasmuch know thou hast been many years judge nation do more cheerfully answer myself
because thou mayest understand there yet twelve days since went jerusalem worship
neither found temple disputing any man raising people synagogues nor city
neither can prove things whereof now accuse
confess thee after way call heresy so worship god fathers believing things written law prophets
hope toward god themselves also allow there resurrection dead both just unjust
herein do exercise myself always conscience void offence toward god men
now after many years came bring alms nation offerings
whereupon certain jews asia found purified temple neither multitude nor tumult
who ought been here before thee object if had against

except one voice cried standing among touching resurrection dead am called question by you day
felix heard these things having more perfect knowledge way deferred said lysias chief captain come down know uttermost your matter
commanded centurion keep paul let liberty should forbid none acquaintance minister or come
after certain days felix came wife drusilla jewess sent paul heard concerning faith christ
reasoned righteousness temperance judgment come felix trembled answered go thy way time convenient season call thee
hoped also money should been given paul might loose wherefore sent oftener communed
after two years porcius festus came felix' room felix willing shew jews pleasure left paul bound
now festus come province after three days ascended caesarea jerusalem
then high priest chief jews informed against paul besought
desired favour against would send jerusalem laying wait way kill
festus answered paul should kept at caesarea himself would depart shortly thither
let therefore said among you able go down accuse man if there any wickedness
had tarried among more than ten days went down caesarea next day sitting on judgment seat commanded paul brought
come jews came down jerusalem stood round about laid many grievous complaints against paul could prove
while answered himself neither against law jews temple nor yet caesar offended any thing at
festus willing do jews pleasure answered paul said wilt thou go jerusalem there judged these things before
then said paul stand at caesar's judgment seat where ought judged jews done no wrong thou very well knowest
if offender or committed any thing worthy death refuse die there none these things whereof accuse no man may deliver appeal caesar
then festus had conferred council answered hast thou appealed caesar shalt go
after certain days king agrippa bernice came caesarea salute festus
had been there many days festus declared paul's cause king saying certain man left bonds by felix
about whom at jerusalem chief priests elders jews informed desiring judgment against
whom answered manner romans deliver any man die before accused accusers face licence answer himself concerning crime laid against
therefore come hither without any delay on morrow sat judgment seat commanded man brought forth
against whom accusers stood brought none accusation such things supposed
had certain questions against own superstition one jesus dead whom paul affirmed alive
because doubted such manner questions asked whether would go jerusalem there judged these matters
paul had appealed reserved hearing augustus commanded kept till might send caesar
then agrippa said festus would also hear man myself morrow thou shalt
on morrow agrippa come bernice great pomp entered place hearing chief captains principal men city at festus' commandment paul brought forth
festus said king agrippa men here present us ye see man about whom multitude jews dealt both at jerusalem also crying ought live any longer
found had committed nothing worthy death himself hath appealed augustus determined send
whom no certain thing write lord wherefore brought forth before you specially thee o king agrippa after examination had might somewhat
seemeth unreasonable send prisoner withal signify crimes laid against
then agrippa said paul thou art permitted speak thyself stretched forth hand answered himself
think myself happy king agrippa because answer day before thee touching things whereof am accused jews
especially because know thee expert customs questions among jews wherefore beseech hear patiently
manner life youth at first among mine own nation jerusalem know jews
knew beginning if would testify after most straitest sect our religion lived pharisee
now stand am judged hope promise made god our fathers
promise our twelve tribes instantly serving god day night hope come hope's sake king agrippa am accused jews
why should thought thing incredible you god raise dead
verily thought myself ought do many things contrary name jesus nazareth
thing also did jerusalem many saints shut prison having received authority chief priests put death gave voice against
punished oft every synagogue compelled blaspheme being exceedingly mad against persecuted even strange cities
whereupon went damascus authority commission chief priests
at midday o king saw way light heaven above brightness sun shining round about journeyed
we fallen earth heard voice speaking saying hebrew tongue saul why persecutest thou hard thee kick against pricks
said who art thou lord am jesus whom persecutest
rise stand upon thy feet appeared thee purpose make minister witness both these things thou hast seen those appear
delivering thee people gentiles whom now send
open eyes turn darkness light power satan god may receive forgiveness sins inheritance among sanctified by faith
whereupon o king agrippa disobedient heavenly vision
shewed first damascus at jerusalem throughout coasts judaea then gentiles should repent turn god do works meet repentance
these causes jews caught temple went about kill
having therefore obtained help god continue day witnessing both small great saying none other things than those prophets moses did say should come
christ should suffer first rise dead shew light people gentiles
thus spake himself festus said loud voice paul thou art beside thyself much learning doth make thee mad
said am mad most noble festus speak forth words truth soberness
king knoweth these things before whom also speak freely am persuaded none hidden thing done corner
king agrippa believest thou prophets know
then agrippa said paul almost thou persuadest christian
paul said would god only thou also hear day both almost altogether such am except these bonds
had thus spoken king rose governor bernice sat
gone aside talked between themselves saying man doeth nothing worthy death or bonds
then said agrippa festus man might been set at liberty if had appealed caesar
determined we should sail italy delivered paul certain other prisoners one named julius centurion augustus' band
entering ship adramyttium we launched meaning sail by coasts asia one aristarchus macedonian thessalonica being us
next day we touched at sidon julius courteously entreated paul gave liberty go friends refresh himself
we had launched thence sailed under cyprus because winds contrary
we had sailed over sea cilicia pamphylia came myra city lycia
there centurion found ship alexandria sailing italy put us therein
we had sailed slowly many days scarce come over against cnidus wind suffering us under crete salmone
hardly passing came place called fair havens nigh whereunto city lasea
now much time spent sailing dangerous because fast already past paul admonished
said sirs perceive voyage hurt much damage only lading ship also our lives
nevertheless centurion believed master owner ship more than those things spoken by paul
because haven commodious winter more part advised depart thence also if by any means might attain phenice there crete lieth toward south west north
south wind blew softly supposing had obtained purpose loosing thence sailed close by crete
long after there arose against tempestuous wind called euroclydon
ship caught could bear wind we let her drive
running under certain island called clauda we had much work come by boat
had taken used helps undergirding ship fearing lest should fall quicksands strake sail so driven
we being exceedingly tossed tempest next day lightened ship
third day we cast out our own hands tackling ship
neither sun nor stars many days appeared no small tempest lay on us hope we should saved then taken away
after long abstinence paul stood forth midst said sirs ye should hearkened loosed crete gained harm loss
now exhort you good cheer there no loss any man's life among ship
there stood by night angel god whose am whom serve
saying fear paul thou must brought before caesar lo god hath given thee sail
wherefore sirs good cheer believe god even told
howbeit we must cast upon certain island
fourteenth night come we driven down adria about midnight shipmen deemed drew near some country
sounded found twenty fathoms had gone little further again fifteen
then fearing lest we should fallen upon rocks cast four anchors out stern wished day
shipmen about flee out ship had let down boat sea under colour though would cast anchors foreship
paul said centurion soldiers except these abide ship ye cannot saved
then soldiers cut off ropes boat let her fall
while day coming on paul besought take meat saying fourteenth ye tarried continued fasting having taken nothing
wherefore pray you take some meat your health there hair fall head any
had thus spoken took bread gave thanks god presence broken began eat
then good cheer also took some meat
we ship two hundred threescore sixteen souls
had eaten enough lightened ship cast out wheat sea
day knew land discovered certain creek shore minded if possible thrust ship
had taken anchors committed themselves sea loosed rudder bands hoised mainsail wind made toward shore
falling place where two seas met ran ship aground forepart stuck fast remained unmoveable hinder part broken violence waves
soldiers' counsel kill prisoners lest any should swim out escape
centurion willing save paul kept purpose commanded could swim should cast themselves first sea get land
rest some on boards broken pieces ship so came pass escaped safe land
escaped then knew island called melita
barbarous people shewed us no little kindness kindled fire received every one because present rain cold
paul had gathered bundle sticks laid on fire there came viper out heat fastened hand
barbarians saw venomous beast hang on hand said among themselves no doubt man murderer whom though hath escaped sea yet vengeance suffereth live
shook off beast fire felt no harm
howbeit looked should swollen or fallen down dead suddenly after had great while saw no harm come changed minds said god
same quarters possessions chief man island whose name publius who received us lodged three days courteously
came pass father publius lay sick fever bloody flux whom paul entered prayed laid hands on healed
so done others also had diseases island came healed
who also honoured us many honours we departed laded such things necessary
after three months we departed ship alexandria had wintered isle whose sign castor pollux
landing at syracuse we tarried there three days
thence we fetched compass came rhegium after one day south wind blew next puteoli
where we found brethren desired tarry seven days so went toward rome
thence brethren heard us came meet far appii forum three taverns whom paul saw thanked god took courage
we came rome centurion delivered prisoners captain guard paul suffered dwell by himself soldier kept
came pass after three days paul called chief jews together come said men brethren though committed nothing against people or customs our fathers yet delivered prisoner jerusalem hands romans
who had examined would let go because there no cause death
jews spake against constrained appeal caesar had ought accuse nation
cause therefore called you see speak because hope israel am bound chain
said we neither received letters out judaea concerning thee any brethren came shewed or spake harm
we desire hear thee what thou thinkest concerning sect know every where spoken against
had appointed day there came many lodging whom expounded testified kingdom god persuading concerning jesus both out law moses prophets morning till evening
some believed things spoken
agreed among themselves departed after paul had spoken one word well spake holy ghost by esaias prophet our fathers
saying go people say hearing ye hear understand seeing see perceive
heart people waxed gross ears dull hearing eyes closed lest should see hear understand converted heal
known therefore you salvation god sent gentiles hear
had said these words jews departed great reasoning among themselves
paul dwelt two whole years own hired house received came
preaching kingdom god teaching those things concern lord jesus christ confidence no man forbidding
paul servant jesus christ called apostle separated gospel god
had promised afore by prophets holy scriptures
concerning son jesus christ our lord made seed david according flesh
declared son god power according spirit holiness by resurrection dead
by whom we received grace apostleship obedience faith among nations name
among whom ye also called jesus christ
rome beloved god called saints grace you peace our father lord jesus christ
first thank god through jesus christ you your faith spoken throughout whole world
god witness whom serve spirit gospel son without ceasing make mention you always prayers
making request if by any means now at length might prosperous journey god come you
long see you may impart some spiritual gift end ye established
may comforted together you by mutual faith both
now would you ignorant brethren oftentimes purposed come let hitherto might some fruit among also even other gentiles
am debtor both greeks barbarians wise unwise
so much am ready preach gospel you at rome also
am ashamed gospel christ power god salvation every one believeth jew first also greek
therein righteousness god revealed faith written just live by
wrath god revealed heaven against ungodliness unrighteousness men who hold truth
because may known god manifest hath shewed
invisible things creation world clearly seen being understood by made even eternal power godhead so without excuse
because knew god glorified neither thankful became vain imaginations foolish heart darkened
professing themselves wise became fools
changed glory uncorruptible god image made like corruptible man birds fourfooted beasts creeping things
wherefore god also gave uncleanness through lusts own hearts dishonour bodies between themselves
who changed truth god lie worshipped served creature more than creator blessed ever amen
cause god gave vile affections even women did change natural use against nature
likewise also men leaving natural use woman burned lust one toward another working unseemly receiving themselves recompence error meet
even did like retain god knowledge gave over reprobate mind do those things convenient
being filled unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers
backbiters haters god despiteful proud boasters inventors evil things disobedient parents
without understanding covenantbreakers natural affection implacable unmerciful
who knowing judgment god commit such things worthy death only do same pleasure
therefore thou art inexcusable o man whosoever judgest wherein another condemnest thyself doest same things
we sure judgment god according truth against commit such things
thinkest thou o man judgest do such things doest same shalt escape judgment god
or despisest thou riches goodness forbearance longsuffering knowing god leadeth thee repentance
after thy hardness impenitent heart treasurest thyself wrath against day revelation righteous judgment god
who render every man according deeds
who by patient continuance well doing seek glory honour immortality eternal life
contentious do obey truth unrighteousness indignation wrath
tribulation anguish upon every soul man doeth evil jew first also gentile
glory honour peace every man worketh good jew first also gentile
there no respect persons god
many sinned without law also perish judged by
hearers law just before god doers justified
gentiles law do by nature things contained these having themselves
shew work law written hearts conscience also bearing witness thoughts mean while accusing or else excusing one another
day god judge secrets men by jesus christ according gospel
behold thou art called jew restest law makest thy boast god
knowest approvest things more excellent being instructed out law
art confident thou thyself guide blind light darkness
instructor foolish teacher babes hast form knowledge truth law
thou therefore teachest another thyself preachest man should steal dost
thou sayest man should commit adultery dost abhorrest idols sacrilege
thou makest thy boast law through breaking dishonourest god
name god blasphemed among gentiles through you written
circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep law breaker thy made uncircumcision
therefore if uncircumcision keep righteousness law counted circumcision
uncircumcision by nature if fulfil law judge thee who letter circumcision dost transgress
jew one outwardly neither circumcision outward flesh
jew one inwardly circumcision heart spirit letter whose praise men god
what advantage then hath jew or profit there circumcision
much every way chiefly because committed oracles god
what if some did believe unbelief make faith god without effect
god forbid yea let true every man liar written thou mightest justified thy sayings overcome art judged
if our unrighteousness commend righteousness god what we say unrighteous who taketh vengeance speak man
god forbid then how judge world
if truth god hath more abounded through lie glory why yet am also judged sinner
rather we slanderously reported some affirm say let us do evil good may come whose damnation just
what then we better than no wise before proved both jews gentiles under sin
written there none righteous no one
there none understandeth seeketh after god
gone out way together become unprofitable there none doeth good no one
throat open sepulchre tongues used deceit poison asps under lips
whose mouth full cursing bitterness
feet swift shed blood
destruction misery ways
way peace known
there no fear god before eyes
now we know what things soever law saith who under every mouth may stopped world become guilty before god
therefore by deeds law there no flesh justified sight knowledge sin
now righteousness god without law manifested being witnessed by prophets
even righteousness god by faith jesus christ upon believe there no difference
sinned come short glory god
being justified freely by grace through redemption christ jesus
whom god hath set forth propitiation through faith blood declare righteousness remission sins past forbearance
declare say at time righteousness might just justifier believeth jesus
where boasting then excluded by what law works nay faith
therefore we conclude man justified by faith without deeds law
god jews only also gentiles yes
seeing one god justify circumcision by faith uncircumcision through
do we then make void law through faith god forbid yea establish
what we say then abraham our father pertaining flesh hath found
if abraham justified by works hath whereof glory before god
what saith scripture abraham believed god counted righteousness
now worketh reward reckoned grace debt
worketh believeth on justifieth ungodly faith counted righteousness
even david also describeth blessedness man whom god imputeth righteousness without works
saying blessed whose iniquities forgiven sins covered
blessed man whom lord impute sin
cometh blessedness then upon circumcision only or uncircumcision also we say faith reckoned abraham righteousness
how then reckoned circumcision or uncircumcision
received sign circumcision seal righteousness faith had yet being uncircumcised might father believe though circumcised imputed also
father circumcision who only also walk steps faith our abraham had being yet uncircumcised
promise should heir world abraham or seed through law righteousness faith
if law heirs faith made void promise none effect
because law worketh wrath where no there transgression
therefore faith might by grace end promise sure seed only law also abraham who father us
written made thee father many nations before whom believed even god who quickeneth dead calleth those things though
who against hope believed might become father many nations according spoken so thy seed
being weak faith considered own body now dead about hundred years old neither yet deadness sara's womb
staggered at promise god through unbelief strong faith giving glory
being fully persuaded what had promised able also perform
therefore imputed righteousness
now written sake alone imputed
us also whom imputed if we believe on raised jesus our lord dead
who delivered our offences raised again justification
therefore being justified by faith we peace god through our lord jesus christ
by whom also we access faith grace wherein stand rejoice hope glory god
only so we glory tribulations also knowing tribulation worketh patience
patience experience hope
hope maketh ashamed because love god shed abroad our hearts by holy ghost given us
we yet without strength due time christ died ungodly
scarcely righteous man one die yet peradventure good some would even dare
god commendeth love toward us while we yet sinners christ died
much more then being now justified by blood we saved wrath through
if we enemies reconciled god by death son much more being saved life
only so we also joy god through our lord jesus christ by whom now received atonement
wherefore by one man sin entered world death so passed upon men sinned
until law sin world imputed there no
nevertheless death reigned adam moses even over had sinned after similitude adam's transgression who figure come
offence so also free gift if through one many dead much more grace god by man jesus christ hath abounded
by one sinned so gift judgment condemnation free many offences justification
if by one man's offence death reigned much more receive abundance grace gift righteousness reign life jesus christ
therefore by offence one judgment came upon men condemnation even so righteousness free gift justification life
by one man's disobedience many made sinners so obedience righteous
moreover law entered offence might abound where sin abounded grace did much more
sin hath reigned death even so might grace reign through righteousness eternal life by jesus christ our lord
what we say then continue sin grace may abound
god forbid how we dead sin live any longer therein
know ye so many us baptized jesus christ death
therefore we buried by baptism death like christ raised dead glory father even so also should walk newness life
if we been planted together likeness death also resurrection
knowing our old man crucified body sin might destroyed henceforth we should serve
dead freed sin
now if we dead christ believe also live
knowing christ being raised dead dieth no more death hath dominion over
died sin once liveth god
likewise reckon ye also yourselves dead indeed sin alive god through jesus christ our lord
let sin therefore reign your mortal body ye should obey lusts thereof
neither yield ye your members instruments unrighteousness sin yourselves god those alive dead righteousness
sin dominion over you ye under law grace
what then we sin because under law grace god forbid
know ye whom yield yourselves servants obey whether sin death or obedience righteousness
god thanked ye servants sin obeyed heart form doctrine delivered you
being then made free sin ye became servants righteousness
speak after manner men because infirmity your flesh ye yielded members servants uncleanness iniquity even so now yield righteousness holiness
ye servants sin free righteousness
what fruit had ye then those things whereof now ashamed end death
now being made free sin become servants god ye your fruit holiness end everlasting life
wages sin death gift god eternal life through jesus christ our lord
know ye brethren speak law how hath dominion over man long liveth
woman hath husband bound by law her so long liveth if dead she loosed
so then if while her husband liveth she married another man called adulteress dead free law no though
wherefore brethren ye also become dead law by body christ should married another even who raised we bring forth fruit god
we flesh motions sins by law did work our members bring forth fruit death
now we delivered law being dead wherein held should serve newness spirit oldness letter
what we say then law sin god forbid nay had known by lust except said thou shalt covet
sin taking occasion by commandment wrought manner concupiscence without law dead
alive without law once commandment came sin revived died
commandment ordained life found death
sin taking occasion by commandment deceived slew
wherefore law holy commandment just good
then good made death god forbid sin might appear working by commandment become exceeding sinful
we know law spiritual am carnal sold under sin
do allow what would hate
if then do would consent law good
now then no more do sin dwelleth
know flesh dwelleth no good thing present how perform find
good would do evil
now if do would no more sin dwelleth
find then law would do good evil present
delight law god after inward man
see another law members warring against mind bringing captivity sin
o wretched man am who deliver body death
thank god through jesus christ our lord so then mind myself serve law flesh sin
there therefore now no condemnation christ jesus who walk after flesh spirit
law spirit life christ jesus hath made free sin death
what law could do weak through flesh god sending own son likeness sinful sin condemned
righteousness law might fulfilled us who walk after flesh spirit
after flesh do mind things spirit
carnally minded death spiritually life peace
because carnal mind enmity against god subject law neither indeed can
so then flesh cannot please god
ye flesh spirit if so god dwell you now any man christ none
if christ you body dead because sin spirit life righteousness
if spirit raised jesus dead dwell you christ also quicken your mortal bodies by dwelleth
therefore brethren we debtors flesh live after
if ye live after flesh die through spirit do mortify deeds body
many led by spirit god sons
ye received spirit bondage again fear adoption whereby we cry abba father
spirit itself beareth witness our we children god
if children then heirs god jointheirs christ so we suffer may also glorified together
reckon sufferings present time worthy compared glory revealed us
earnest expectation creature waiteth manifestation sons god
creature made subject vanity willingly by reason who hath subjected same hope
because creature itself also delivered bondage corruption glorious liberty children god
we know whole creation groaneth travaileth pain together until now
only ourselves also firstfruits spirit even we groan within waiting adoption wit redemption our body
we saved by hope seen what man seeth why doth yet
if we hope see then do patience wait
likewise spirit also helpeth our infirmities we know what should pray ought itself maketh intercession us groanings cannot uttered
searcheth hearts knoweth what mind spirit because maketh intercession saints according god
we know things work together good love god who called according purpose
whom did foreknow also predestinate conformed image son might firstborn among many brethren
moreover whom did predestinate also called justified glorified
what we then say these things if god us who can against
spared own son delivered us how also freely give things
who lay any thing charge god's elect god justifieth
who condemneth christ died yea rather risen again even at right hand god also maketh intercession us
who separate us love christ tribulation or distress persecution famine nakedness peril sword
written thy sake we killed day long accounted sheep slaughter
nay these things we more than conquerors through loved us
am persuaded neither death nor life angels principalities powers things present come
nor height depth any other creature able separate us love god christ jesus our lord
say truth christ lie conscience also bearing witness holy ghost
great heaviness continual sorrow heart
could wish myself accursed christ brethren kinsmen according flesh
who israelites whom pertaineth adoption glory covenants giving law service god promises
whose fathers whom concerning flesh christ came who over god blessed ever amen
though word god hath taken none effect israel
neither because seed abraham children isaac thy called
children flesh these god promise counted seed
word promise at time come sara son
only rebecca also had conceived by one even our father isaac
children being yet born neither having done any good or evil purpose god according election might stand works calleth
said her elder serve younger
written jacob loved esau hated
what we say then there unrighteousness god forbid
saith moses mercy on whom compassion
so then willeth nor runneth god sheweth mercy
scripture saith pharaoh even same purpose raised thee might shew power name declared throughout earth
therefore hath mercy on whom hardeneth
thou wilt say then why doth yet find fault who hath resisted
nay o man who art thou repliest against god thing formed say why hast made thus
hath potter power over clay same lump make one vessel honour another dishonour
what if god willing shew wrath make power known endured much longsuffering vessels fitted destruction
might make known riches glory on vessels mercy had afore prepared
even us whom hath called jews only also gentiles
saith also osee call people her beloved
come pass place where said ye people there called children living god
esaias also crieth concerning israel though number children sand sea remnant saved
finish work cut short righteousness because lord make upon earth
esaias said before except lord sabaoth had left us seed we been sodoma made like gomorrha
what we say then gentiles followed after righteousness attained even faith
israel followed after law righteousness hath attained
wherefore because sought by faith works law stumbled at stumblingstone
written behold lay sion stumblingstone rock offence whosoever believeth on ashamed
brethren heart's desire prayer god israel might saved
bear record zeal god according knowledge
being ignorant god's righteousness going about establish own submitted themselves god
christ end law righteousness every one believeth
moses describeth righteousness law man doeth those things live by
righteousness faith speaketh on wise say thine heart who ascend heaven bring christ down above
or who descend deep bring christ again dead
what saith word nigh thee even thy mouth heart faith we preach
if thou shalt confess thy mouth lord jesus believe thine heart god hath raised dead saved
heart man believeth righteousness mouth confession made salvation
scripture saith whosoever believeth on ashamed
there no difference between jew greek same lord over rich call upon
whosoever call upon name lord saved
how then call on whom believed believe heard hear without preacher
how preach except sent written beautiful feet gospel peace bring glad tidings good things
obeyed gospel esaias saith lord who hath believed our report
so then faith cometh by hearing word god
say heard yes verily sound went earth words ends world
say did israel know first moses saith provoke you jealousy by no people foolish nation anger
esaias very bold saith found sought made manifest asked after
israel saith day long stretched forth hands disobedient gainsaying people
say then hath god cast away people forbid also am israelite seed abraham tribe benjamin
god hath cast away people foreknew wot ye what scripture saith elias how maketh intercession against israel saying
lord killed thy prophets digged down thine altars am left alone seek life
what saith answer god reserved myself seven thousand men who bowed knee image baal
even so then at present time also there remnant according election grace
if by grace then no more works otherwise work
what then israel hath obtained seeketh election rest blinded
according written god hath given spirit slumber eyes should see ears hear day
david saith let table made snare trap stumblingblock recompence
let eyes darkened may see bow down back alway
say then stumbled should fall god forbid rather through salvation come gentiles provoke jealousy
now if fall riches world diminishing gentiles how much more fulness
speak you gentiles inasmuch am apostle magnify mine office
if by any means may provoke emulation flesh might save some
if casting away reconciling world what receiving life dead
if firstfruit holy lump also root so branches
if some branches broken off thou being wild olive tree wert graffed among partakest root fatness
boast against branches if thou bearest root thee
thou wilt say then branches broken off might graffed
well because unbelief broken off thou standest by faith highminded fear
if god spared natural branches take heed lest also spare thee
behold therefore goodness severity god on fell toward thee if thou continue otherwise also shalt cut off
also if abide still unbelief graffed god able graff again
if thou wert cut out olive tree wild by nature graffed contrary good how much more these natural branches own
would brethren ye should ignorant mystery lest wise your own conceits blindness part happened israel until fulness gentiles come
so israel saved written there come out sion deliverer turn away ungodliness jacob
covenant take away sins
concerning gospel enemies your sakes touching election beloved fathers'
gifts calling god without repentance
ye times past believed god yet now obtained mercy through unbelief
even so these also now believed through your mercy may obtain
god hath concluded unbelief might mercy upon
o depth riches both wisdom knowledge god how unsearchable judgments ways past finding out
who hath known mind lord or been counsellor
or who hath first given recompensed again
through things whom glory ever amen
beseech you therefore brethren by mercies god ye present your bodies living sacrifice holy acceptable reasonable service
conformed world ye transformed by renewing your mind may prove what good acceptable perfect god
say through grace given every man among you think himself more highly than ought soberly according god hath dealt measure faith
we many members one body same office
so we being many one body christ every members another
having then gifts differing according grace given us whether prophecy let prophesy proportion faith
or ministry let us wait on our ministering teacheth teaching
or exhorteth on exhortation giveth let do simplicity ruleth diligence sheweth mercy cheerfulness
let love without dissimulation abhor evil cleave good
kindly affectioned one another brotherly love honour preferring
slothful business fervent spirit serving lord
rejoicing hope patient tribulation continuing instant prayer
distributing necessity saints given hospitality
bless persecute you curse
rejoice do weep
same mind one toward another high things condescend men low estate wise your own conceits
recompense no man evil provide things honest sight men
if possible much lieth you live peaceably men
dearly beloved avenge yourselves rather give place wrath written vengeance mine repay saith lord
therefore if thine enemy hunger feed thirst give drink so doing thou shalt heap coals fire on head
overcome evil good
let every soul subject higher powers there no power god ordained
whosoever therefore resisteth power ordinance god resist receive themselves damnation
rulers terror good works evil wilt thou then afraid power do shalt praise same
minister god thee good if thou do evil afraid beareth sword vain revenger execute wrath upon doeth
wherefore ye must needs subject only wrath also conscience sake
cause pay ye tribute also god's ministers attending continually upon very thing
render therefore dues tribute whom due custom fear honour
owe no man any thing love one another loveth hath fulfilled law
thou shalt commit adultery kill steal bear false witness covet if there any other commandment briefly comprehended saying namely love thy neighbour thyself
love worketh no ill neighbour therefore fulfilling law
knowing time now high awake out sleep our salvation nearer than we believed

christ divided paul crucified you or ye baptized name
thank god baptized none you crispus gaius
lest any should say had baptized mine own name
baptized also household stephanas besides know whether any other
christ sent baptize preach gospel wisdom words lest cross should made none effect
preaching cross perish foolishness us saved power god
written destroy wisdom wise bring nothing understanding prudent
where wise scribe disputer world hath god made foolish wisdom
after wisdom god world by knew pleased foolishness preaching save believe
jews require sign greeks seek after wisdom
we preach christ crucified jews stumblingblock greeks foolishness
called both jews greeks christ power god wisdom
because foolishness god wiser than men weakness stronger
ye see your calling brethren how many wise men after flesh mighty noble called
god hath chosen foolish things world confound wise weak mighty
base things world despised hath god chosen yea bring nought
no flesh should glory presence
ye christ jesus who god made us wisdom righteousness sanctification redemption
according written glorieth let glory lord
brethren came you excellency speech or wisdom declaring testimony god
determined know any thing among you save jesus christ crucified
you weakness fear much trembling
speech preaching enticing words man's wisdom demonstration spirit power
your faith should stand wisdom men power god
howbeit we speak wisdom among perfect yet world nor princes come nought
we speak wisdom god mystery even hidden ordained before world our glory
none princes world knew had known would crucified lord glory
written eye hath seen nor ear heard neither entered heart man things god prepared love
god hath revealed us by spirit searcheth things yea deep
what man knoweth things save spirit even so god no
now we received spirit world god might know things freely given us
things also we speak words man's wisdom teacheth holy ghost comparing spiritual
natural man receiveth things spirit god foolishness neither can know because spiritually discerned
spiritual judgeth things yet himself judged no man
who hath known mind lord may instruct we christ
brethren could speak you spiritual carnal even babes christ
fed you milk meat hitherto ye able bear neither yet now
ye yet carnal whereas there among you envying strife divisions walk men
while one saith am paul another apollos ye carnal
who then paul apollos ministers by whom ye believed even lord gave every man
planted apollos watered god gave increase
so then neither planteth any thing watereth god giveth increase
now planteth watereth one every man receive own reward according labour
we labourers together god ye god's husbandry building
according grace god given wise masterbuilder laid foundation another buildeth thereon let every man take heed how thereupon
other foundation can no man lay than laid jesus christ
now if any man build upon foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble
every man's work made manifest day declare because revealed by fire try what sort
if any man's work abide hath built thereupon receive reward
if any man's work burned suffer loss himself saved yet so by fire
know ye temple god spirit dwelleth you
if any man defile temple god destroy holy ye
let no man deceive himself if any among you seemeth wise world become fool may
wisdom world foolishness god written taketh wise own craftiness
again lord knoweth thoughts wise vain
therefore let no man glory men things your's
whether paul or apollos cephas world life death things present come your's
ye christ's christ god's
let man so account us ministers christ stewards mysteries god
moreover required stewards man found faithful
very small thing should judged you or man's judgment yea judge mine own self
know nothing by myself yet am hereby justified judgeth lord
therefore judge nothing before time until lord come who both bring light hidden things darkness make manifest counsels hearts then every man praise god
these things brethren figure transferred myself apollos your sakes ye might learn us think men above written no one you puffed against another
who maketh thee differ another what hast thou didst receive now if why dost glory hadst received
now ye full rich reigned kings without us would god did reign we also might you
think god hath set forth us apostles last appointed death we made spectacle world angels men
we fools christ's sake ye wise christ weak strong honourable despised
even present hour we both hunger thirst naked buffeted no certain dwellingplace
labour working our own hands being reviled we bless persecuted suffer
being defamed we intreat made filth world offscouring things day
write these things shame you beloved sons warn
though ye ten thousand instructors christ yet many fathers jesus begotten you through gospel
wherefore beseech you ye followers
cause sent you timotheus who beloved son faithful lord bring remembrance ways christ teach every where church
now some puffed though would come you
come you shortly if lord know speech puffed power
kingdom god word power
what ye come you rod or love spirit meekness
reported commonly there fornication among you such so much named gentiles one should father's wife
ye puffed rather mourned hath done deed might taken away among you
verily absent body present spirit judged already though concerning hath so done deed
name our lord jesus christ ye gathered together spirit power
deliver such one satan destruction flesh spirit may saved day lord jesus
your glorying good know ye little leaven leaveneth whole lump
purge out therefore old leaven ye may new lump unleavened even christ our passover sacrificed us
therefore let us keep feast old leaven neither malice wickedness unleavened bread sincerity truth
wrote you epistle company fornicators
yet altogether fornicators world or covetous extortioners idolaters then must ye needs go out
now written you keep company if any man called brother fornicator or covetous idolater railer drunkard extortioner such one no eat
what do judge also without ye within
without god judgeth therefore put away among yourselves wicked person
dare any you having matter against another go law before unjust saints
do ye know saints judge world if judged by you unworthy smallest matters
know ye we judge angels how much more things pertain life
if then ye judgments things pertaining life set judge who least esteemed church
speak your shame so there wise man among you no one able judge between brethren
brother goeth law before unbelievers
now therefore there utterly fault among you because ye go law one another why do rather take wrong suffer yourselves defrauded
nay ye do wrong defraud your brethren
know ye unrighteous inherit kingdom god deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters adulterers effeminate abusers themselves mankind
nor thieves covetous drunkards revilers extortioners inherit kingdom god
such some you ye washed sanctified justified name lord jesus by spirit our god
things lawful expedient brought under power any
meats belly god destroy both now body fornication lord
god hath both raised lord also raise us by own power
know ye your bodies members christ then take make harlot god forbid
what know ye joined harlot one body two saith flesh
joined lord one spirit
flee fornication every sin man doeth without body committeth sinneth against own
what know ye your body temple holy ghost you god own
ye bought price therefore glorify god your body spirit god's
now concerning things whereof ye wrote good man touch woman
nevertheless avoid fornication let every man own wife woman her husband
let husband render wife due benevolence likewise also
wife hath power her own body husband likewise also
defraud ye one other except consent time may give yourselves fasting prayer come together again satan tempt you your incontinency
speak by permission commandment
would men even myself every man hath proper gift god one after manner another
say therefore unmarried widows good if abide even
if cannot contain let marry better than burn
married command yet lord let wife depart her husband
if she depart let her remain unmarried or reconciled husband put away wife
rest speak lord if any brother hath wife believeth she pleased dwell let put her away
woman hath husband believeth if pleased dwell her let leave
unbelieving husband sanctified by wife else your children unclean now holy
if unbelieving depart let brother or sister under bondage such cases god hath called us peace
what knowest thou o wife whether shalt save thy husband or how man
god hath distributed every man lord called one so let walk ordain churches
any man called being circumcised let become uncircumcised uncircumcision
circumcision nothing uncircumcision keeping commandments god
let every man abide same calling wherein called
art thou called being servant care if mayest made free use rather
called lord being servant lord's freeman likewise also free christ's
ye bought price servants men
brethren let every man wherein called therein abide god
now concerning virgins no commandment lord yet give judgment one hath obtained mercy faithful
suppose therefore good present distress say man so
art thou bound wife seek loosed
if thou marry hast sinned virgin she hath nevertheless such trouble flesh spare you
say brethren time short remaineth both wives though had none
weep though wept rejoice rejoiced buy possessed
use world abusing fashion passeth away
would you without carefulness unmarried careth things belong lord how may please
married careth things world how may please wife
there difference also between wife virgin unmarried woman careth things lord she may holy both body spirit married world how please her husband
speak your own profit may cast snare upon you comely ye attend lord without distraction
if any man think behaveth himself uncomely toward virgin she pass flower her age need so require let do what sinneth marry
nevertheless standeth stedfast heart having no necessity hath power over own so decreed keep virgin doeth well
so then giveth her marriage doeth well better
wife bound by law long her husband liveth if dead she at liberty married whom only lord
she happier if so abide after judgment think also spirit god
now touching things offered idols we know knowledge puffeth charity edifieth
if any man think knoweth thing nothing yet ought know
if any man love god same known
concerning therefore eating those things offered sacrifice idols we know idol nothing world there none other god one
though there called gods whether heaven or earth many lords
us there one god father whom things we lord jesus christ by
howbeit there every man knowledge some conscience idol hour eat thing offered being weak defiled
meat commendeth us god neither if we eat better worse
take heed lest by any means liberty your's become stumblingblock weak
if any man see thee hast knowledge sit at meat idol's temple conscience weak emboldened eat those things offered idols
through thy knowledge weak brother perish whom christ died
ye sin so against brethren wound weak conscience christ
wherefore if meat make brother offend eat no flesh while world standeth lest
am apostle free seen jesus christ our lord ye work
if apostle others yet doubtless am you seal mine apostleship ye lord
mine answer do examine
we power eat drink
we power lead about sister wife well other apostles brethren lord cephas
or only barnabas we power forbear working
who goeth warfare any time at own charges planteth vineyard eateth fruit thereof or feedeth flock milk
say these things man or saith law same also
written law moses thou shalt muzzle mouth ox treadeth out corn doth god take care oxen
or saith altogether our sakes no doubt written ploweth should plow hope thresheth partaker
if we sown you spiritual things great thing reap your carnal
if others partakers power over you we rather nevertheless used suffer things lest should hinder gospel christ
do ye know minister about holy things live temple wait at altar partakers
even so hath lord ordained preach gospel should live
used none these things neither written should so done better die than any man make glorying void
though preach gospel nothing glory necessity laid upon yea woe if
if do thing willingly reward against dispensation gospel committed
what reward then verily preach gospel may make christ without charge abuse power
though free men yet made myself servant might gain more
jews became jew might gain under law
without law being god under christ might gain
weak became might gain am made things men by means save some
do gospel's sake might partaker thereof you
know ye run race one receiveth prize so may obtain
every man striveth mastery temperate things now do obtain corruptible crown we incorruptible
therefore so run uncertainly fight one beateth air
keep under body bring subjection lest by any means preached others myself should castaway
moreover brethren would ye should ignorant how our fathers under cloud passed through sea
baptized moses cloud sea
did eat same spiritual meat
did drink same spiritual drank rock followed christ
many god well pleased overthrown wilderness
now these things our examples intent we should lust after evil also lusted
neither ye idolaters some written people sat down eat drink rose play
neither let us commit fornication some committed fell one day three twenty thousand
neither let us tempt christ some also tempted destroyed serpents
neither murmur ye some also murmured destroyed destroyer
now these things happened ensamples written our admonition upon whom ends world come
wherefore let thinketh standeth take heed lest fall
there hath no temptation taken you such common man god faithful who suffer tempted above ye able also make way escape may bear
wherefore dearly beloved flee idolatry
speak wise men judge ye what say
cup blessing we bless communion blood christ bread break body
we being many one bread body partakers
behold israel after flesh eat sacrifices partakers altar
what say then idol any thing or offered sacrifice idols
say things gentiles sacrifice devils god would ye should fellowship
ye cannot drink cup lord devils partakers lord's table
do we provoke lord jealousy stronger than
things lawful expedient edify
let no man seek own every another's wealth
whatsoever sold shambles eat asking no question conscience sake
earth lord's fulness thereof
if any believe bid you feast ye disposed go whatsoever set before eat asking no question conscience sake
if any man say you offered sacrifice idols eat sake shewed conscience earth lord's fulness thereof
conscience say thine own other why liberty judged another man's
if by grace partaker why am evil spoken give thanks
whether therefore ye eat or drink whatsoever do glory god
give none offence neither jews nor gentiles church god
even please men things seeking mine own profit many may saved
ye followers even also am christ
now praise you brethren ye remember things keep ordinances delivered
would you know head every man christ woman god
every man praying or prophesying having head covered dishonoureth
every woman prayeth or prophesieth her head uncovered dishonoureth even one if she shaven
if woman covered let her also shorn shame or shaven
man indeed ought cover head forasmuch image glory god woman
man woman
neither man created woman
cause ought woman power on her head because angels
nevertheless neither man without woman lord
woman man even so also by things god
judge yourselves comely woman pray god uncovered
doth even nature itself teach you if man long hair shame
if woman long hair glory her given covering
if any man seem contentious we no such custom neither churches god
now declare you praise ye come together better worse
first ye come together church hear there divisions among you partly believe
there must also heresies among you approved may made manifest
ye come together therefore one place eat lord's supper
eating every one taketh before other own supper hungry another drunken
what ye houses eat drink or despise church god shame say you praise
received lord also delivered you jesus same night betrayed took bread
had given thanks brake said take eat body broken you do remembrance
after same manner also took cup had supped saying new testament blood do ye oft drink remembrance
often ye eat bread drink cup do shew lord's death till come
wherefore whosoever eat bread drink cup lord unworthily guilty body blood
let man examine himself so eat bread drink cup
eateth drinketh unworthily damnation himself discerning lord's body
cause many weak sickly among you sleep
if we would judge ourselves should judged
we judged chastened lord should condemned world
wherefore brethren ye come together eat tarry one another
if any man hunger let eat at home ye come together condemnation rest set order
now concerning spiritual gifts brethren would you ignorant
ye know gentiles carried away these dumb idols even led
wherefore give you understand no man speaking by spirit god calleth jesus accursed can say lord holy ghost
now there diversities gifts same spirit
there differences administrations same lord
there diversities operations same god worketh
manifestation spirit given every man profit withal
one given by spirit word wisdom another knowledge same
another faith by same spirit gifts healing
another working miracles prophecy discerning spirits divers kinds tongues interpretation
these worketh one selfsame spirit dividing every man severally
body one hath many members being so also christ
by one spirit we baptized body whether jews or gentiles bond free been made drink
body one member many
if foot say because am hand body therefore
if ear say because am eye body therefore
if whole body eye where hearing smelling
now hath god set members every one body pleased
if one member where body
now many members yet one body
eye cannot say hand no need thee nor again head feet you
nay much more those members body seem feeble necessary
those members body we think less honourable upon these bestow more abundant honour our uncomely parts comeliness
our comely parts no need god hath tempered body together having given more abundant honour part lacked
there should no schism body members same care one another
whether one member suffer members or honoured rejoice
now ye body christ members particular
god hath set some church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after miracles then gifts healings helps governments diversities tongues
apostles prophets teachers workers miracles
gifts healing do speak tongues interpret
covet earnestly best gifts yet shew you more excellent way
though speak tongues men angels charity am become sounding brass or tinkling cymbal
though gift prophecy understand mysteries knowledge faith so could remove mountains charity am nothing
though bestow goods feed poor give body burned charity profiteth nothing
charity suffereth long kind envieth vaunteth itself puffed
doth behave itself unseemly seeketh her own easily provoked thinketh no evil
rejoiceth iniquity truth
beareth things believeth hopeth endureth
charity never faileth whether there prophecies fail tongues cease knowledge vanish away
we know part prophesy
perfect come then part done away
child spake understood thought became man put away childish things
now we see through glass darkly then face know part even also am known
now abideth faith hope charity these three greatest
follow after charity desire spiritual gifts rather ye may prophesy
speaketh unknown tongue men god no man understandeth howbeit spirit mysteries
prophesieth speaketh men edification exhortation comfort
speaketh unknown tongue edifieth himself prophesieth church
would ye spake tongues rather prophesied greater prophesieth than speaketh except interpret church may receive edifying
now brethren if come you speaking tongues what profit except speak either by revelation or knowledge prophesying doctrine
even things without life giving sound whether pipe or harp except give distinction sounds how known what piped harped
if trumpet give uncertain sound who prepare himself battle
so likewise ye except utter by tongue words easy understood how known what spoken speak air
there may so many kinds voices world none without signification
therefore if know meaning voice speaketh barbarian
even so ye forasmuch zealous spiritual gifts seek may excel edifying church
wherefore let speaketh unknown tongue pray may interpret
if pray unknown tongue spirit prayeth understanding unfruitful
what then pray spirit understanding also sing
else thou shalt bless spirit how occupieth room unlearned say amen at thy giving thanks seeing understandeth what sayest
thou verily givest thanks well other edified
thank god speak tongues more than ye
yet church had rather speak five words understanding by voice might teach others also than ten thousand unknown tongue
brethren children understanding howbeit malice ye men
law written men other tongues lips speak people yet hear saith lord
wherefore tongues sign believe prophesying serveth
if therefore whole church come together one place speak tongues there those unlearned or unbelievers say ye mad
if prophesy there come one believeth or unlearned convinced judged
thus secrets heart made manifest so falling down on face worship god report you truth
how then brethren ye come together every one you hath psalm doctrine tongue revelation interpretation let things done edifying
if any man speak unknown tongue let by two or at most three course one interpret
if there no interpreter let keep silence church speak himself god
let prophets speak two or three other judge
if any thing revealed another sitteth by let first hold peace
ye may prophesy one by learn comforted
spirits prophets subject
god author confusion peace churches saints
let your women keep silence churches permitted speak commanded under obedience also saith law
if learn any thing let ask husbands at home shame women speak church
what came word god out you or only
if any man think himself prophet or spiritual let acknowledge things write you commandments lord
if any man ignorant let
wherefore brethren covet prophesy forbid speak tongues
let things done decently order
moreover brethren declare you gospel preached also ye received wherein stand
by also ye saved if keep memory what preached you unless believed vain
delivered you first also received how christ died our sins according scriptures
buried rose again third day according scriptures
seen cephas then twelve
after seen above five hundred brethren at once whom greater part remain present some fallen asleep
after seen james then apostles
last seen also one born out due time
am least apostles meet called apostle because persecuted church god
by grace god am what bestowed upon vain laboured more abundantly than yet
therefore whether or so we preach ye believed
now if christ preached rose dead how say some among you there no resurrection
if there no resurrection dead then christ risen
if christ risen then our preaching vain your faith also
yea we found false witnesses god because testified raised christ whom if so dead rise
if dead rise then christ raised
if christ raised your faith vain ye yet sins
then also fallen asleep christ perished
if life only we hope christ men most miserable
now christ risen dead become firstfruits slept
since by man came death also resurrection dead
adam die even so christ made alive
every man own order christ firstfruits afterward christ's at coming
then cometh end delivered kingdom god even father put down rule authority power
must reign till hath put enemies under feet
last enemy destroyed death
hath put things under feet saith manifest excepted did
things subdued then son also himself subject put under god may
else what do baptized dead if rise at why then
why stand we jeopardy every hour
protest by your rejoicing christ jesus our lord die daily
if after manner men fought beasts at ephesus what advantageth dead rise let us eat drink morrow we die
deceived evil communications corrupt good manners
awake righteousness sin some knowledge god speak your shame
some man say how dead raised what body do come
thou fool sowest quickened except die
thou sowest body bare grain may chance wheat or some other
god giveth body hath pleased every seed own
flesh same there one kind men another beasts fishes birds
there also celestial bodies terrestrial glory one another
there one glory sun another moon stars star differeth
so also resurrection dead sown corruption raised incorruption
sown dishonour raised glory weakness power
sown natural body raised spiritual there
so written first man adam made living soul last quickening spirit
howbeit first spiritual natural afterward
first man earth earthy second lord heaven
earthy such also heavenly
we borne image earthy also bear heavenly
now say brethren flesh blood cannot inherit kingdom god neither doth corruption incorruption
behold shew you mystery we sleep changed
moment twinkling eye at last trump trumpet sound dead raised incorruptible we changed
corruptible must put on incorruption mortal immortality
so corruptible put on incorruption mortal immortality then brought pass saying written death swallowed victory
o death where thy sting grave victory
sting death sin strength law
thanks god giveth us victory through our lord jesus christ
therefore beloved brethren ye stedfast unmoveable always abounding work lord forasmuch know your labour vain
now concerning collection saints given order churches galatia even so do ye
upon first day week let every one you lay by store god hath prospered there no gatherings come
come whomsoever ye approve by your letters send bring liberality jerusalem
if meet go also
now come you pass through macedonia do
may abide yea winter you ye bring on journey whithersoever go
see you now by way trust tarry while if lord permit
tarry at ephesus until pentecost
great door effectual opened there many adversaries
now if timotheus come see may you without fear worketh work lord also do
let no man therefore despise conduct forth peace may come look brethren
touching our brother apollos greatly desired come you brethren at time convenient
watch ye stand fast faith quit you like men strong
let your things done charity
beseech you brethren ye know house stephanas firstfruits achaia addicted themselves ministry saints
ye submit yourselves such every one helpeth us laboureth
am glad coming stephanas fortunatus achaicus lacking on your part supplied
refreshed spirit your's therefore acknowledge ye such
churches asia salute you aquila priscilla much lord church house
brethren greet you ye one another holy kiss
salutation paul mine own hand
if any man love lord jesus christ let anathema maranatha
grace our lord jesus christ you
love you christ jesus amen
paul apostle jesus christ by god timothy our brother church at corinth saints achaia
grace you peace god our father lord jesus christ
blessed god even father our lord jesus christ mercies comfort
who comforteth us our tribulation we may able comfort any trouble by wherewith ourselves comforted god
sufferings christ abound us so our consolation also aboundeth by
whether we afflicted your consolation salvation effectual enduring same sufferings also suffer or comforted
our hope you stedfast knowing ye partakers sufferings so also consolation
we would brethren you ignorant our trouble came us asia pressed out measure above strength insomuch despaired even life
we had sentence death ourselves should trust god raiseth dead
who delivered us so great death doth deliver whom we trust yet
ye also helping together by prayer us gift bestowed upon means many persons thanks may given on our behalf
our rejoicing testimony conscience simplicity godly sincerity fleshly wisdom by grace god we had conversation world more abundantly youward
we write none other things you than what ye read or acknowledge trust even end
also ye acknowledged us part we your rejoicing even our's day lord jesus
confidence minded come you before ye might second benefit
pass by you macedonia come again out brought on way toward judaea
therefore thus minded did use lightness or things purpose do according flesh there should yea nay
god true our word toward you yea nay
son god jesus christ who preached among you by us even silvanus timotheus yea nay
promises god yea amen glory by us
now stablisheth us you christ hath anointed god
who hath also sealed us given earnest spirit our hearts
moreover call god record upon soul spare you came yet corinth
we dominion over your faith helpers joy by ye stand
determined myself would come again you heaviness
if make you sorry who then maketh glad same made by
wrote same you lest came should sorrow whom ought rejoice having confidence joy
out much affliction anguish heart wrote you many tears ye should grieved might know love more abundantly
if any caused grief hath grieved part may overcharge you
sufficient such man punishment inflicted many
so contrariwise ye ought rather forgive comfort lest perhaps such one should swallowed overmuch sorrow
wherefore beseech you ye would confirm your love toward
end also did write might know proof you whether ye obedient things
whom ye forgive any thing also if forgave your sakes person christ
lest satan should get advantage us we ignorant devices
furthermore came troas preach christ's gospel door opened lord
had no rest spirit because found titus brother taking leave went thence macedonia
now thanks god always causeth us triumph christ maketh manifest savour knowledge by every place
we god sweet savour christ saved perish
one we savour death other life who sufficient these things
we many corrupt word god sincerity sight speak christ
do we begin again commend ourselves or need some others epistles commendation you letters
ye our epistle written hearts known read men
forasmuch ye manifestly declared epistle christ ministered by us written ink spirit living god tables stone fleshy heart
such trust we through christ godward
we sufficient ourselves think any thing our sufficiency god
who also hath made us able ministers new testament letter spirit killeth giveth life
if ministration death written engraven stones glorious so children israel could stedfastly behold face moses glory countenance done away
how ministration spirit rather glorious
if ministration condemnation glory much more doth righteousness exceed
even made glorious had no glory respect by reason excelleth
if done away glorious much more remaineth
seeing then we such hope use great plainness speech
moses put vail over face children israel could stedfastly look end abolished
minds blinded until day remaineth same vail untaken away reading old testament done christ
even day moses read vail upon heart
nevertheless turn lord vail taken away
now lord spirit where there liberty
we open face beholding glass glory lord changed same image even by spirit
therefore seeing we ministry received mercy faint
renounced hidden things dishonesty walking craftiness nor handling word god deceitfully by manifestation truth commending ourselves every man's conscience sight
if our gospel hid lost
whom god world hath blinded minds believe lest light glorious gospel christ who image should shine
we preach ourselves christ jesus lord your servants jesus' sake
god who commanded light shine out darkness hath shined our hearts give knowledge glory face jesus christ
we treasure earthen vessels excellency power may god us
we troubled on every side yet distressed perplexed despair
persecuted forsaken cast down destroyed
always bearing about body dying lord jesus life also might made manifest our
we live alway delivered death jesus' sake life also jesus might made manifest our mortal flesh
so then death worketh us life you
we having same spirit faith according written believed therefore spoken also believe speak
knowing raised lord jesus raise us also by present you
things your sakes abundant grace might through thanksgiving many redound glory god
cause we faint though our outward man perish yet inward renewed day by
our light affliction moment worketh us far more exceeding eternal weight glory

whiles by experiment ministration glorify god your professed subjection gospel christ liberal distribution men
by prayer you long after exceeding grace god
thanks god unspeakable gift
now paul myself beseech you by meekness gentleness christ who presence am base among being absent bold toward
beseech you may bold am present confidence wherewith think against some us if we walked according flesh
though we walk flesh do war after
weapons our warfare carnal mighty through god pulling down strong holds
casting down imaginations every high thing exalteth itself against knowledge god bringing captivity thought obedience christ
having readiness revenge disobedience your obedience fulfilled
do ye look on things after outward appearance if any man trust himself christ's let think again even so we
though should boast somewhat more our authority lord hath given us edification your destruction ashamed
may seem if would terrify you by letters
letters say weighty powerful bodily presence weak speech contemptible
let such one think we word by letters absent also deed present
we dare make ourselves number or compare some commend themselves measuring by comparing among wise
we boast things without our measure according rule god hath distributed us reach even you
we stretch ourselves beyond our measure though reached you come far also preaching gospel christ
boasting things without our measure other men's labours having hope your faith increased we enlarged by you according rule abundantly
preach gospel regions beyond you boast another man's line things made ready our hand
glorieth let glory lord
commendeth himself approved whom lord
would god ye could bear little folly indeed
am jealous over you godly jealousy espoused one husband may present chaste virgin christ
fear lest by any means serpent beguiled eve through subtilty so your minds should corrupted simplicity christ
if cometh preacheth another jesus whom we preached or ye receive spirit received gospel accepted might well bear
suppose whit behind very chiefest apostles
though rude speech yet knowledge we been throughly made manifest among you things
committed offence abasing myself ye might exalted because preached you gospel god freely
robbed other churches taking wages do you service
present you wanted chargeable no man lacking brethren came macedonia supplied things kept myself being burdensome so keep
truth christ no man stop boasting regions achaia
wherefore because love you god knoweth
what do may cut off occasion desire wherein glory found even we
such false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves christ
no marvel satan himself transformed angel light
therefore no great thing if ministers also transformed righteousness whose end according works
say again let no man think fool if otherwise yet receive may boast myself little
speak after lord foolishly confidence boasting
seeing many glory after flesh also
ye suffer fools gladly seeing yourselves wise
ye suffer if man bring you bondage devour take exalt himself smite on face
speak concerning reproach though we had been weak howbeit whereinsoever any bold foolishly am also
hebrews so am israelites seed abraham
ministers christ speak fool am more labours abundant stripes above measure prisons frequent deaths oft
jews five times received forty stripes save one
thrice beaten rods once stoned suffered shipwreck night day been deep
journeyings often perils waters robbers by mine own countrymen heathen city wilderness sea among false brethren
weariness painfulness watchings often hunger thirst fastings cold nakedness
beside those things without cometh upon daily care churches
who weak am offended burn
if must needs glory things concern mine infirmities
god father our lord jesus christ blessed evermore knoweth lie
damascus governor under aretas king kept city damascenes garrison desirous apprehend
through window basket let down by wall escaped hands
expedient doubtless glory come visions revelations lord
knew man christ above fourteen years ago whether body cannot tell or out god knoweth such one caught third heaven
knew such man whether body or out cannot tell god knoweth
how caught paradise heard unspeakable words lawful man utter
such one glory yet myself mine infirmities
though would desire glory fool say truth now forbear lest any man should think above seeth or heareth
lest should exalted above measure through abundance revelations there given thorn flesh messenger satan buffet
thing besought lord thrice might depart
said grace sufficient thee strength made perfect weakness most gladly therefore rather glory infirmities power christ may rest upon
therefore take pleasure infirmities reproaches necessities persecutions distresses christ's sake am weak then strong
am become fool glorying ye compelled ought been commended you nothing behind very chiefest apostles though
truly signs apostle wrought among you patience wonders mighty deeds
what wherein ye inferior other churches except myself burdensome you forgive wrong
behold third time am ready come you burdensome seek your's children ought lay parents
very gladly spend spent you though more abundantly love less loved
so did burden you nevertheless being crafty caught guile
did make gain you by any whom sent
desired titus sent brother did make gain you walked we same spirit steps
again think ye we excuse ourselves you speak before god christ do things dearly beloved your edifying
fear lest come find you such would found ye there debates envyings wraths strifes backbitings whisperings swellings tumults
lest come again god humble among you bewail many sinned already repented uncleanness fornication lasciviousness committed
third time am coming you mouth two or three witnesses every word established
told you before foretell if present second time being absent now write heretofore sinned other come again spare
since ye seek proof christ speaking youward weak mighty you
though crucified through weakness yet liveth by power god we also weak live toward you
examine yourselves whether ye faith prove your own selves know how jesus christ you except reprobates
trust ye know we reprobates
now pray god ye do no evil we should appear approved honest though reprobates
we can do nothing against truth
we glad weak ye strong also wish even your perfection
therefore write these things being absent lest present should use sharpness according power lord hath given edification destruction
finally brethren farewell perfect good comfort one mind live peace god love you
greet one another holy kiss
saints salute you
grace lord jesus christ love god communion holy ghost you amen
paul apostle men neither by man jesus christ god father who raised dead
brethren churches galatia
grace you peace god father our lord jesus christ
who gave himself our sins might deliver us present evil world according god father
whom glory ever amen
marvel ye so soon removed called you grace christ another gospel
another there some trouble you would pervert gospel christ
though we or angel heaven preach any other gospel you than preached let accursed
we said before so say now again if any man preach other gospel you than ye received let accursed
do now persuade men or god seek please if yet pleased should servant christ
certify you brethren gospel preached after man
neither received man taught by revelation jesus christ
ye heard conversation time past jews' religion how beyond measure persecuted church god wasted
profited jews' religion above many equals mine own nation being more exceedingly zealous traditions fathers
pleased god who separated mother's womb called by grace
reveal son might preach among heathen immediately conferred flesh blood
neither went jerusalem apostles before arabia returned again damascus
then after three years went jerusalem see peter abode fifteen days
other apostles saw none save james lord's brother
now things write you behold before god lie
afterwards came regions syria cilicia
unknown by face churches judaea christ
had heard only persecuted us times past now preacheth faith once destroyed
glorified god
then fourteen years after went again jerusalem barnabas took titus also
went by revelation communicated gospel preach among gentiles privately reputation lest any means should run or had vain
neither titus who being greek compelled circumcised
because false brethren unawares brought who came privily spy out our liberty we christ jesus might bring us bondage
whom we gave place by subjection no hour truth gospel might continue you
these who seemed somewhat whatsoever maketh no matter god accepteth man's person conference added nothing
contrariwise saw gospel uncircumcision committed circumcision peter
wrought effectually peter apostleship circumcision same mighty toward gentiles
james cephas john who seemed pillars perceived grace given gave barnabas right hands fellowship we should go heathen circumcision
only would we should remember poor same also forward do
peter come antioch withstood face because blamed
before certain came james did eat gentiles come withdrew separated himself fearing circumcision
other jews dissembled likewise insomuch barnabas also carried away dissimulation
saw walked uprightly according truth gospel said peter before if thou being jew livest after manner gentiles do jews why compellest live
we who jews by nature sinners gentiles
knowing man justified by works law faith jesus christ even we believed might no flesh
if while we seek justified by christ ourselves also found sinners therefore minister sin god forbid
if build again things destroyed make myself transgressor
through law am dead might live god
am crucified christ nevertheless live yet liveth life now flesh by faith son god who loved gave himself
do frustrate grace god if righteousness come by law then christ dead vain
o foolish galatians who hath bewitched you ye should obey truth before whose eyes jesus christ been evidently set forth crucified among
only would learn you received ye spirit by works law or hearing faith
ye so foolish having begun spirit now made perfect by flesh
ye suffered so many things vain if yet
therefore ministereth you spirit worketh miracles among doeth by works law or hearing faith
even abraham believed god accounted righteousness
know ye therefore faith same children abraham
scripture foreseeing god would justify heathen through faith preached before gospel abraham saying thee nations blessed
so then faith blessed faithful abraham
many works law under curse written cursed every one continueth things book do
no man justified by law sight god evident just live faith
law faith man doeth live
christ hath redeemed us curse law being made written cursed every one hangeth on tree
blessing abraham might come on gentiles through jesus christ we receive promise spirit faith
brethren speak after manner men though man's covenant yet if confirmed no man disannulleth or addeth thereto
now abraham seed promises made saith seeds many one thy christ
say covenant confirmed before god christ law four hundred thirty years after cannot disannul should make promise none effect
if inheritance law no more promise god gave abraham by
wherefore then serveth law added because transgressions till seed should come whom promise made ordained by angels hand mediator
now mediator one god
law then against promises god forbid if there had been given could life verily righteousness should by
scripture hath concluded under sin promise by faith jesus christ might given believe
before faith came we kept under law shut should afterwards revealed
wherefore law our schoolmaster bring us christ we might justified by faith
after faith come we no longer under schoolmaster
ye children god by faith christ jesus
many you been baptized christ put on
there neither jew nor greek bond free male female ye one christ jesus
if ye christ's then abraham's seed heirs according promise
now say heir long child differeth nothing servant though lord
under tutors governors until time appointed father
even so we children bondage under elements world
fulness time come god sent forth son made woman under law
redeem under law we might receive adoption sons
because ye sons god hath sent forth spirit son your hearts crying abba father
wherefore thou art no more servant son if then heir god through christ
howbeit then ye knew god did service by nature no gods
now after ye known god or rather how turn again weak beggarly elements whereunto desire bondage
ye observe days months times years
am afraid you lest bestowed upon labour vain
brethren beseech you am ye injured at
ye know how through infirmity flesh preached gospel you at first
temptation flesh ye despised nor rejected received angel god even christ jesus
where then blessedness ye spake bear you record if had been possible would plucked out your own eyes given
am therefore become your enemy because tell you truth
zealously affect you well yea would exclude ye might
good zealously affected always thing only am present you
little children whom travail birth again until christ formed you
desire present you now change voice stand doubt
tell ye desire under law do hear
written abraham had two sons one by bondmaid other freewoman
who bondwoman born after flesh freewoman by promise
things allegory these two covenants one mount sinai gendereth bondage agar
agar mount sinai arabia answereth jerusalem now bondage her children
jerusalem above free mother us
written rejoice thou barren bearest break forth cry travailest desolate hath many more children than she husband
now we brethren isaac children promise
then born after flesh persecuted spirit even so now
nevertheless what saith scripture cast out bondwoman her son heir freewoman
so then brethren we children bondwoman free
stand fast therefore liberty wherewith christ hath made us free entangled again yoke bondage
behold paul say you if ye circumcised christ profit nothing
testify again every man circumcised debtor do whole law
christ become no effect you whosoever justified by law ye fallen grace
we through spirit wait hope righteousness by faith
jesus christ neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision faith worketh by love
ye did run well who hinder you should obey truth
persuasion cometh calleth you
little leaven leaveneth whole lump
confidence you through lord ye none otherwise minded troubleth bear judgment whosoever
brethren if yet preach circumcision why do suffer persecution then offence cross ceased
would even cut off trouble you
brethren ye been called liberty only use occasion flesh by love serve one another
law fulfilled one word even thou shalt love thy neighbour thyself
if ye bite devour one another take heed consumed
say then walk spirit ye fulfil lust flesh
flesh lusteth against spirit these contrary one other so ye cannot do things would
if ye led spirit under law
now works flesh manifest these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness
idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies
envyings murders drunkenness revellings such like tell you before also told time past do things inherit kingdom god
fruit spirit love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith
meekness temperance against such there no law
christ's crucified flesh affections lusts
if we live spirit let us also walk
let us desirous vain glory provoking one another envying
brethren if man overtaken fault ye spiritual restore such one spirit meekness considering thyself lest thou also tempted
bear ye one another's burdens so fulfil law christ
if man think himself something nothing deceiveth
let every man prove own work then rejoicing himself alone another
every man bear own burden
let taught word communicate teacheth good things
deceived god mocked whatsoever man soweth also reap
soweth flesh reap corruption spirit life everlasting
let us weary well doing due season we reap if faint
we therefore opportunity let us do good men especially who household faith

many desire make fair shew flesh constrain you circumcised only lest should suffer persecution cross christ
neither themselves who circumcised keep law desire you may glory your flesh
god forbid should glory save cross our lord jesus christ by whom world crucified

god who at sundry times divers manners spake time past fathers by prophets
hath these last days spoken us by son whom appointed heir things also made worlds
who being brightness glory express image person upholding things by word power had himself purged our sins sat down on right hand majesty high
being made so much better than angels hath by inheritance obtained more excellent name
angels said at any time thou art son day begotten thee again father
again bringeth firstbegotten world saith let angels god worship
angels saith who maketh spirits ministers flame fire
son saith thy throne o god ever sceptre righteousness kingdom
thou hast loved righteousness hated iniquity therefore god even thy hath anointed thee oil gladness above fellows
thou lord beginning hast laid foundation earth heavens works thine hands
perish thou remainest wax old doth garment
vesture shalt thou fold changed art same thy years fail
angels said at any time sit on right hand until make thine enemies thy footstool
ministering spirits sent forth minister who heirs salvation
therefore we ought give more earnest heed things heard lest at any time should let slip
if word spoken by angels stedfast every transgression disobedience received just recompence reward
how we escape if neglect so great salvation at first began spoken by lord confirmed us heard
god also bearing witness both signs wonders divers miracles gifts holy ghost according own
angels hath put subjection world come whereof we speak
one certain place testified saying what man thou art mindful or son visitest
thou madest little lower than angels crownedst glory honour didst set over works thy hands
thou hast put things subjection under feet left nothing now we see yet
we see jesus who made little lower than angels suffering death crowned glory honour by grace god should taste every man
became whom things by bringing many sons glory make captain salvation perfect through sufferings
both sanctifieth who sanctified one cause ashamed call brethren
saying declare thy name brethren midst church sing praise thee
again put trust behold children god hath given
forasmuch then children partakers flesh blood also himself likewise took part same through death might destroy had power devil
deliver who through fear death lifetime subject bondage
verily took on nature angels seed abraham
wherefore things behoved made like brethren might merciful faithful high priest pertaining god make reconciliation sins people
himself hath suffered being tempted able succour
wherefore holy brethren partakers heavenly calling consider apostle high priest our profession christ jesus
who faithful appointed also moses house
man counted worthy more glory than moses inasmuch who hath builded house honour
every house builded by some man built things god
moses verily faithful house servant testimony those things spoken after
christ son over own house whose we if hold fast confidence rejoicing hope firm end
wherefore holy ghost saith day if ye hear voice
harden your hearts provocation day temptation wilderness
your fathers tempted proved saw works forty years
wherefore grieved generation said do alway err heart known ways
so sware wrath enter rest
take heed brethren lest there any you evil heart unbelief departing living god
exhort one another daily while called day lest any you hardened through deceitfulness sin
we made partakers christ if hold beginning our confidence stedfast end
while said day if ye hear voice harden your hearts provocation
some had heard did provoke howbeit came out egypt by moses
whom grieved forty years had sinned whose carcases fell wilderness
whom sware should enter rest believed
so we see could enter because unbelief
let us therefore fear lest promise being left entering rest any you should seem come short
us gospel preached well word did profit being mixed faith heard
we believed do enter rest said sworn wrath if although works finished foundation world
spake certain place seventh day on wise god did rest works
place again if enter rest
seeing therefore remaineth some must enter therein whom first preached entered because unbelief
again limiteth certain day saying david after so long time said if ye hear voice harden your hearts
if jesus had given rest then would afterward spoken another day
there remaineth therefore rest people god
entered rest also hath ceased own works god did
let us labour therefore enter rest lest any man fall after same example unbelief
word god quick powerful sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even dividing asunder soul spirit joints marrow discerner thoughts intents heart
neither there any creature manifest sight things naked opened eyes whom we do
seeing then we great high priest passed heavens jesus son god let us hold fast our profession
we high priest cannot touched feeling our infirmities points tempted like yet without sin
let us therefore come boldly throne grace we may obtain mercy find help time need
every high priest taken among men ordained things pertaining god may offer both gifts sacrifices sins
who can compassion on ignorant out way himself also compassed infirmity
by reason hereof ought people so also himself offer sins
no man taketh honour himself called god aaron
so also christ glorified himself made high priest said thou art son day begotten thee
saith also another place thou art priest ever after order melchisedec
who days flesh had offered prayers supplications strong crying tears able save death heard feared
though son yet learned obedience by things suffered
being made perfect became author eternal salvation obey
called god high priest after order melchisedec
whom we many things say hard uttered seeing ye dull hearing
time ye ought teachers need one teach you again first principles oracles god become such milk strong meat
every one useth milk unskilful word righteousness babe
strong meat belongeth full age even those who by reason use senses exercised discern both good evil
therefore leaving principles doctrine christ let us go on perfection laying again foundation repentance dead works faith toward god
doctrine baptisms laying on hands resurrection dead eternal judgment
we do if god permit
impossible those who once enlightened tasted heavenly gift made partakers holy ghost
tasted good word god powers world come
if fall away renew again repentance seeing crucify themselves son god afresh put open shame
earth drinketh rain cometh oft upon bringeth forth herbs meet by whom dressed receiveth blessing god
beareth thorns briers rejected nigh cursing whose end burned
beloved we persuaded better things you accompany salvation though thus speak
god unrighteous forget your work labour love ye shewed toward name ministered saints do minister
we desire every one you do shew same diligence full assurance hope end
ye slothful followers who through faith patience inherit promises
god made promise abraham because could swear by no greater sware himself
saying surely blessing bless thee multiplying multiply
so after had patiently endured obtained promise
men verily swear by greater oath confirmation end strife
wherein god willing more abundantly shew heirs promise immutability counsel confirmed by oath
by two immutable things impossible god lie we might strong consolation who fled refuge lay hold upon hope set before us
hope we anchor soul both sure stedfast entereth within veil
whither forerunner us entered even jesus made high priest ever after order melchisedec
melchisedec king salem priest most high god who met abraham returning slaughter kings blessed
whom also abraham gave tenth part first being by interpretation king righteousness after salem peace
without father mother descent having neither beginning days nor end life made like son god abideth priest continually
now consider how great man whom even patriarch abraham gave tenth spoils
verily sons levi who receive office priesthood commandment take tithes people according law brethren though come out loins abraham
whose descent counted received tithes abraham blessed had promises
without contradiction less blessed better
here men die receive tithes there receiveth whom witnessed liveth
may so say levi also who receiveth tithes payed abraham
yet loins father melchisedec met
if therefore perfection by levitical priesthood under people received law what further need there another priest should rise after order melchisedec called aaron
priesthood being changed there made necessity change also law
whom these things spoken pertaineth another tribe no man gave attendance at altar
evident our lord sprang out juda tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood
yet far more evident after similitude melchisedec there ariseth another priest
who made after law carnal commandment power endless life
testifieth thou art priest ever after order melchisedec
there verily disannulling commandment going before weakness unprofitableness thereof
law made nothing perfect bringing better hope did by we draw nigh god
inasmuch without oath made priest
those priests made without oath by said lord sware repent thou art priest ever after order melchisedec
by so much jesus made surety better testament
truly many priests because suffered continue by reason death
man because continueth ever hath unchangeable priesthood
wherefore able also save uttermost come god by seeing ever liveth make intercession
such high priest became us who holy harmless undefiled separate sinners made higher than heavens
who needeth daily those high priests offer sacrifice first own sins then people's did once offered himself
law maketh men high priests infirmity word oath since son who consecrated evermore
now things we spoken sum such high priest who set on right hand throne majesty heavens
minister sanctuary true tabernacle lord pitched man
every high priest ordained offer gifts sacrifices wherefore necessity man somewhat also
if on earth should priest seeing there priests offer gifts according law
who serve example shadow heavenly things moses admonished god about make tabernacle see saith thou according pattern shewed thee mount
now hath obtained more excellent ministry by how much also mediator better covenant established upon promises
if first covenant had been faultless then should no place sought second
finding fault saith behold days come lord make new covenant house israel judah
according covenant made fathers day took by hand lead out land egypt because continued regarded saith lord
covenant make house israel after those days saith lord put laws mind write hearts god people
teach every man neighbour brother saying know lord least greatest
merciful unrighteousness sins iniquities remember no more
saith new covenant hath made first old now decayeth waxeth ready vanish away
then verily first covenant had also ordinances divine service worldly sanctuary
there tabernacle made first wherein candlestick table shewbread called sanctuary
after second veil tabernacle called holiest
had golden censer ark covenant overlaid round about gold wherein pot manna aaron's rod budded tables
over cherubims glory shadowing mercyseat we cannot now speak particularly
now these things thus ordained priests went always first tabernacle accomplishing service god
second went high priest alone once every year without blood offered himself errors people
holy ghost signifying way holiest yet made manifest while first tabernacle standing
figure time then present offered both gifts sacrifices could make did service perfect pertaining conscience
stood only meats drinks divers washings carnal ordinances imposed on until time reformation
christ being come high priest good things by greater more perfect tabernacle made hands say building
neither by blood goats calves own entered once holy place having obtained eternal redemption us
if blood bulls goats ashes heifer sprinkling unclean sanctifieth purifying flesh
how much more blood christ who through eternal spirit offered himself without spot god purge your conscience dead works serve living
cause mediator new testament by means death redemption transgressions under first called might receive promise eternal inheritance
where testament there must also necessity death testator
testament force after men dead otherwise no strength at while testator liveth
whereupon neither first testament dedicated without blood
moses had spoken every precept people according law took blood calves goats water scarlet wool hyssop sprinkled both book
saying blood testament god hath enjoined you
moreover sprinkled blood both tabernacle vessels ministry
almost things by law purged blood without shedding no remission
therefore necessary patterns things heavens should purified these heavenly themselves better sacrifices than
christ entered holy places made hands figures true heaven itself now appear presence god us
nor yet should offer himself often high priest entereth holy place every year blood others
then must often suffered since foundation world now once end hath appeared put away sin by sacrifice himself
appointed men once die after judgment
so christ once offered bear sins many look appear second time without sin salvation
law having shadow good things come very image can never those sacrifices offered year by continually make comers thereunto perfect
then would ceased offered because worshippers once purged should had no more conscience sins
those sacrifices there remembrance again made sins every year
possible blood bulls goats should take away sins
wherefore cometh world saith sacrifice offering thou wouldest body hast prepared
burnt offerings sacrifices sin thou hast had no pleasure
then said lo come volume book written do thy o god
above said sacrifice offering burnt offerings sin thou wouldest neither hadst pleasure therein offered by law
then said lo come do thy o god taketh away first may establish second
by we sanctified through offering body jesus christ once
every priest standeth daily ministering offering oftentimes same sacrifices can never take away sins
man after had offered one sacrifice sins ever sat down on right hand god
henceforth expecting till enemies made footstool
by one offering hath perfected ever sanctified
whereof holy ghost also witness us after had said before
covenant make after those days saith lord put laws hearts minds write
sins iniquities remember no more
now where remission these there no more offering sin
having therefore brethren boldness enter holiest by blood jesus
by new living way hath consecrated us through veil say flesh
having high priest over house god
let us draw near true heart full assurance faith having our hearts sprinkled evil conscience bodies washed pure water
let us hold fast profession our faith without wavering faithful promised
let us consider one another provoke love good works
forsaking assembling ourselves together manner some exhorting one another so much more ye see day approaching
if we sin wilfully after received knowledge truth there remaineth no more sacrifice sins
certain fearful looking judgment fiery indignation devour adversaries
despised moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses
how much sorer punishment suppose ye thought worthy who hath trodden under foot son god counted blood covenant wherewith sanctified unholy thing done despite spirit grace
we know hath said vengeance belongeth recompense saith lord again judge people
fearful thing fall hands living god
call remembrance former days after ye illuminated endured great fight afflictions
partly whilst ye made gazingstock both by reproaches afflictions became companions so used
ye had compassion bonds took joyfully spoiling your goods knowing yourselves heaven better enduring substance
cast away therefore your confidence hath great recompence reward
ye need patience after done god might receive promise
yet little while come tarry
now just live by faith if any man draw back soul no pleasure
we who draw back perdition believe saving soul
now faith substance things hoped evidence seen
by elders obtained good report
through faith we understand worlds framed by word god so things seen made do appear
by faith abel offered god more excellent sacrifice than cain obtained witness righteous testifying gifts being dead yet speaketh
by faith enoch translated should see death found because god had before translation testimony pleased
without faith impossible please cometh god must believe rewarder diligently seek
by faith noah being warned god things seen yet moved fear prepared ark saving house condemned world became heir righteousness

looked city hath foundations whose builder maker god
through faith also sara herself received strength conceive seed delivered child she past age because judged faithful who had promised
therefore sprang there even one good dead so many stars sky multitude sand by sea shore innumerable
these died faith having received promises seen afar off persuaded embraced confessed strangers pilgrims on earth
say such things declare plainly seek country
truly if had been mindful country whence came out might opportunity returned
now desire better country heavenly wherefore god ashamed called hath prepared city
by faith abraham tried offered isaac had received promises only begotten son
whom said isaac thy seed called
accounting god able raise even dead whence also received figure
by faith isaac blessed jacob esau concerning things come
by faith jacob dying blessed both sons joseph worshipped leaning upon top staff
by faith joseph died made mention departing children israel gave commandment concerning bones
by faith moses born hid three months parents because saw proper child afraid king's commandment
by faith moses come years refused called son pharaoh's daughter
choosing rather suffer affliction people god than enjoy pleasures sin season
esteeming reproach christ greater riches than treasures egypt had respect recompence reward
by faith forsook egypt fearing wrath king endured seeing who invisible
through faith kept passover sprinkling blood lest destroyed firstborn should touch
by faith passed through red sea dry land egyptians assaying do drowned
by faith walls jericho fell down after compassed about seven days
by faith harlot rahab perished believed she had received spies peace
what more say time would fail tell gedeon barak samson jephthae david also samuel prophets
who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped mouths lions
quenched violence fire escaped edge sword out weakness made strong waxed valiant fight turned flight armies aliens
women received dead raised life again others tortured accepting deliverance might obtain better resurrection
others had trial cruel mockings scourgings yea moreover bonds imprisonment
stoned sawn asunder tempted slain sword wandered about sheepskins goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented
whom world worthy wandered deserts mountains dens caves earth
these having obtained good report through faith received promise
god having provided some better thing us without should made perfect
wherefore seeing we also compassed about so great cloud witnesses let us lay aside every weight sin doth easily beset run patience race set before
looking jesus author finisher our faith who joy set before endured cross despising shame down at right hand throne god
consider endured such contradiction sinners against himself lest ye wearied faint your minds
ye yet resisted blood striving against sin
ye forgotten exhortation speaketh you children son despise thou chastening lord nor faint art rebuked
whom lord loveth chasteneth scourgeth every son receiveth
if ye endure chastening god dealeth you sons what son whom father chasteneth
if ye without chastisement whereof partakers then bastards sons
furthermore we had fathers our flesh corrected us gave reverence much rather subjection father spirits live
verily few days chastened us after own pleasure our profit we might partakers holiness
now no chastening present seemeth joyous grievous nevertheless afterward yieldeth peaceable fruit righteousness exercised thereby
wherefore lift hands hang down feeble knees
make straight paths your feet lest lame turned out way let rather healed
follow peace men holiness without no man see lord
looking diligently lest any man fail grace god root bitterness springing trouble you thereby many defiled
lest there any fornicator or profane person esau who one morsel meat sold birthright

there no wise enter any thing defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh lie written lamb's book life
shewed pure river water life clear crystal proceeding out throne god lamb
midst street on either side river there tree life bare twelve manner fruits yielded her fruit every month leaves healing nations
there no more curse throne god lamb servants serve
see face name foreheads
there no night need candle neither light sun lord god giveth reign ever
said these sayings faithful true lord god holy prophets sent angel shew servants things must shortly done

then saith see thou do am thy fellowservant brethren prophets keep sayings book worship god

blessed do commandments may right tree life enter through gates city
without dogs sorcerers whoremongers murderers idolaters whosoever loveth maketh lie

spirit bride say come let heareth athirst whosoever take water life freely

if any man take away words book prophecy god part out life holy city things written
testifieth these things saith surely come quickly amen even so lord jesus
grace our lord jesus christ you amen
