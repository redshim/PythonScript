once the car warms up the trans can become balky when trying to engage 2nd and 3rd under moderate to hard acceleration
bubbling started under hood and wrapped to the surface not caused from road damage
same as corrosion
penny in the the seat belt receptacle i think from the factory

the paint is actually buckling up in a couple of spots on the hood
it sounds like an old chair/mattress spring that's being sat on it is on the driver side front end of the car
there is a rattling noise like it's loose if you push it real hard back into place it will be quiet for a bit but then starts back up within less than 5 minutes
chipping flaking has occurred on the very front of the hood  i bought touch-up paint from the ford dealership and this has alleviated further flaking
the driver and passenger windows fog up quickly right in the side mirror viewing area and it takes forever to clear them
writing is fading on a frequently pushed button
i believe that there was a problem with the factory primer which caused the primary coat or top color coat to bubble as if it were rusting from underneath the paint as the hood is aluminum rust is not possible and i was told by a professional bod
the black exterior trim pieces including the front spoiler cowl rocker panels and rear valence are fading and streaky  additionally the rear bumper color no longer matches the rest of the car despite the car being white  it has never been d
rear bumper color no longer matches the rest of the car despite the car being white it's somewhat yellowed  the car has never been hit or damaged
touch screen based audio/climate/navigation system requires too much visual input to operate requiring driver to take his eyes off the road  i liked my old mustang's systems much more
ford's screen commands require too many steps requiring too much time with my eyes off the road for simple changes especially to climate controls
much more difficult to operate than a garmin  it is not intuitive like a garmin
i rarely use the cup holder door yet there are small worn look scratches where your fingers engage it to open
in dec 2012 i noticed that along the whole front of the hood the paint was bubbling
paint peeling was a result of the rust/corrosion
i have given up using the voice commands and instead use menus
the air conditioner wasn't working properly blowing air but not cool air
sometimes when the remote trunk button is activated or the trunk release button in center console the mechanism that opens the trunk has an electrical noise that lasts about 5 seconds before the latch is released most times it unlatches immediately
blister on front of hood
blister on hood  dealer took photos and ford corporate said that it's not covered until it rusts thru  so i have to wait till i get a hole in hood or pay $900 out of pocket to get repaired at dealership my dealer is more upset about this than
trim popping off
small bubbling chipping and minor flaking
service advancetrac warning lights come on took to dealer but not resolved

the dealership said this loud noise was normal honestly i would never by a v4 again if this is the case
just a blown fuse

in my opinion the honda's that i have owned just have a lot of road noise
poor reception of not really a problem to me
it could be that my battery on my car remote is losing strength
some marks are from people parking near me but some seem to be from little rocks etc while driving

i have had to open my hood maybe 4 or 5 times and almost every time it takes a bit of effort to figure out where the latch is and how it works
the tailgate has a definite rattle i have taken everything out including jack etc and had my son in the back listen it was really noticeable going slow and more when down hill we figured out it is the actual tail gate/ trunk we think it is t
there was a spot that had something on it maybe sap or something and it just peeled the paint up when washing
i think it is due to roof racks having the sun roof open while driving more than 40 mph is too noisy i think it is just the wind going over the roof racks
 at least 2 or 3 times i have lost my phone book i would enter in call mom and have a list of commands then one day i would try to call mom and it would say please give me a number etc and the phone book would be empty
the lights on the buttons go out a lot i had them replaced early on but lately i just don't even bother
the glove box door just flops open now i think it used to have a spring or something that when you clicked the lever to open that it would open slowly it now just flops down and if i am not careful things inside would fall out maybe it has alwa
check engine light came on and another warning and it turned out to be the two pistons that get shut down when it gets in economy mode the dealer cracked open the engine and replaces piston seals or something

the plastic pan under the motor
paint just seems to chip easily  it may be because it's pearl white so it's more noticeable  never noticed so many areas with chips of paint missing on my other cars i have owned
just howling and whistling when driving the vehicle at almost all speeds  only when it's windy outside
hard to keep clean and wear easily

faded with protection finish applied by dealer
lenses broke and fill with moisture
bottom valance tore off
original tires were not good quality from the start and different ones were not an option
wore hole by gas peddle very quickly
cruise control lettering wore off
battery had at least one cell that mechanically failed after hitting pot hole
paint on driver's side is starting to peel
unsure when this developed it is an intermittent problem though
took to dealership when check engine light came on it was the gas cap
it's actually that the remote key fob doesn't always lock the driver-side door i've tried alternate fobs thinking it may have been a battery problem in one fob what's more sometimes the fob locks the door other times not not a big deal i've
it's actually a blob of solder from the welding process which i can see from the driver's seat on the driver-side front-door post
i have noticed one of the passenger-side front wiper vibrating a bit as the car is stopped and idling it also tends to vibrate a high speed
please see my redundant comments above earlier explained in the driver-side door unlocking/opening section
the fabric is such that the surface is pinpoint indentations so crumbs and/or other small particles tend to collect in those areas
i understand this may be typical of fits per their large glass area moreover i live in summer-hot & humid florida i have inquired at my dealer who recommends a $99 a/c check i may do that in the spring prior to next summer
seems i have to crank up the temp control and fan to near-max to get sufficient heat in the car again though as i live in florida this is only an occasional need
choices above provide sufficient info thanks
choices above sufficiently explain all thanks
akin to my comments above i believe all is attributable to plastic-to-plastic construction of the dashboard components which causes the clicking sound
akin to my visor comment above i believe it's solely attributable to glove box components that are plastic-to-plastic in construction which causes the clicking sound
i believe it's solely attributable to its plastic-on-plastic construction which causes the creaking sound

lots of wavy lines in the paint job and spots where the paint has discolored/bubbled a bitbeen this way since it was newjust never bothered to bring it upbut it is a disappointing paint job by hondai expected better
the dealer eventually just put a bead of silicone around the windshield and that eliminated the whistlingdoesn't look great though
the car is just noisier than i think it should be under all conditions  not a quiet ride
the monitor had to be replaced covered by warranty no charge just an annoyance
airbag light came on i was told that the front passenger's airbag was defective no accidents etc just defective out of pocket charge of $800 pretty outrageous
i don't use the voice commands anymoretoo annoying and slow
carpet is extremely cheapworn through near gas pedal

on the space between the front and rear doors the paint began to peel and chip
when driving at speeds there was a loud wind noise from the driver side window
the seat made noises when someone was sitting in the seat
the dash did not properly fit and there was a gap overtime that became larger
faded
just didn't look right dealer said something was sprayed during traffic by another car
loud motor like when moving seat back & forth dealer said it was normal
the problem is on the door handle
hear the noises when rear window is open
flaking
honda has had problems forever with road and wind noise  i rented a nissan and the difference was noticeable
wind noise road noise  vehicle has no noise canceling or noise dampening installation
static
mostly wind noise
notice missing paint on corner and side
i haven't taken it to the dealer just thought it may need an upgrade too much money
bad design when it is raining you cannot even have the windows cracked because water comes in the windows don't leak it is just bad design
the paint finish is a sparkle black it scratches very easily and the paint underneath is white there is no good way to buff this out once scratched no good way to remedy
this is not a quiet ride
seems like tire and wind noise
pulls to the right when going down the highway and pulls to the right when braking i have just noticed this recently
i have just noticed car pulling to the right when braking
constantly coming on
maybe an electrical problem? sometimes it won't close then after many tries it will eventually sunshade on drivers side is sagging now won't stay up
along with the sunroof sometimes the window acts goofy and will open or not close randomly
one electrical outlet in center console was not installed properly so didn't work subsequently another one has stopped working first one fixed under warranty second one after warranty expired not fixed
the flexible fins that hold the cups are torn and worn also the cup holder design makes it difficult to clean
all the vinyl surfaces are a dark finish and scuff easily and scratch easily
just opening the door and having fingernails bump the paint scratches it
the pistons were sticking and it ruined the spark plugs  the pistons were sticking and ruined the spark plugs

 when the vehicle is cold the tires and suspension shutter over bumps in the road the dash pops and i can feel  the chassis flex when my knee is on the door
the body flexes badly and the dealer said they would only make it worse trying to fix it it's an inherent design issue with the veloster the large sunroof compromises the cars integrity so the colder it gets in winter the worse it gets its sou
i decided to ignore the problem the dealer always has an excuse for problems
they did a software update but it didn't help
speedo is 3-5mph off i hope the odometer is reads correctly i'd hate to find out i lost 1000 miles of warranty

don't know it was very cold and after a few hrs and starts the light went out
the part inside of the trunk where you cover the trunk area got warped somehow and was unable to fit normal into the groves and click shut so it was always coming off every time i opened the trunk
anytime the trunk was opened and rain had collected on the car it would just roll right into the back seats or on my kids i didn't think much about it just a design flaw
i didn't know there was a paint problem until after a harsh winter storm and afterwards i took the car to a car wash and a chunk of the paint on the bottom just fell right off there was no dents or anything in the area just missing paint it was 
it would usually say goodbye and think we were done

window motor failed and window would not go down warranty replacement took care of issue
it seems sluggish on accelerating from a stop and hesitates on initial up-shift the dealership did do something with the software to try to improve it and it did get a little better but it seems to just be the way the transmission operates som
makes noise when shifting sometimes it's quieter or louder than other times but the folks at the dealership said it was normal though the first time i believe they did make some adjustments and it seemed quieter
after the first year the paint started to flake in multiple areas
i was told not the dealership that it was common if the oil change is done anywhere other that the dealership

occasionally resists going into first gear have to put it in second then back up to first
paint chipped in front  paint job quality very poor barely any paint in jams areas  of grey the car was orange

cheap material
blower was quite when  got louder after timee
looked like a ten year old car steering wheel after 6 months
after the first year the paint started to flake in multiple areas
i was told not the dealership that it was common if the oil change is done anywhere other that the dealership
instead of black paint on the door trim they used a black sticker that is pealing off when i bought the car i thought it was paint it was only after it started to peal off that i realized it was a sticker
just a very noisy car when driving
the paint had the crackle finish on both the driver and passenger side on pieces of the car that seemed to be hard rubber or cheap soft plastic
when driving at speeds of 75 mph a noise is produced on the sunroof and pressure needs to be applied to get rid of the noise
when driving the vehicle when it's cold you can hear a squeak in the rear passenger  it disappears after driving high speeds and warming up  only happens on cold starts
the volume would sporadically change higher and lower on its own  i never pressed any buttons you could see the volume display increase and decrease whenever
 the material used to cover the sunroof on the interior side has an awful smell when opened  i have to open the sunroof completely and roll the windows down to get rid of the smell
feel as though the pieces are snapped in and don't have proper protection to prevent the squeaking  i have to apply pressure to stop the squeak
same as the previous comment  all snap in pieces and have to apply pressure to prevent the squeak from persisting
the dct has delayed reactions when shifting and feel like i'm in a vehicle built back in the 80's  i feel all the shifts
there are times when the gear stays in a particular gear and i have to use the pedal shifters to force the vehicle to change the gear
i started noticing a noise occurring when shifting in gears  it progressively gotten louder  it mainly happened at low speeds or going into reverse and park  apparently had a bad actuator

i commented on this earlier  the brakes feel like they are pulling qwuite often or like i am straining them and they make a tugging noise  this is usuially when i slow down from a high speed quickly
often when the car was slowing down from a semi high to high speed it felt like it was tugging on the brakes or straining to get it to stop

bird poop stained paint dealership said they could not repair
reported issue to dealer and was told normal with new type of brakes nothing they could do about it
was a key fob issue after 3 weeks in shop
i am sure it was due to limited amount of space in cabin
no matter the level of cleaning seats always looked dirty and faded
air would come on very loud and or sometimes not at all until i restarted car
scraping noise when opening/closing
paint defects were removed at a detailer paid by dealer
voluntarily paid to change to ceramic brakes for the front only
had poor reception in same area as my previous 06 slk but in the same area my 2007 acura mdx reception was ok
problem is just as described
too many steps to input can't operate while car is in motion unless using voice control which has poor recognition
 there were flaws like 'bubbles on the passenger door panel the same flaw was also elsewhere on the dash
seems pretty worn to me dealer said it still functions ok
left and right exhaust manifolds replaced under warranty sounds have since reappeared
same sound as before will take car back at the next service

poor paint quality in general not lasting well compared to other vehicles i have previously owned
loud vehicle lots of road and wind noise especially with the run flat tires the car came with they are very loud and of poor quality needing replacement within less than 30k miles awful!
noisy brakes function adequately just noisy
don't recall specifics
paint chips easily with the slightest bump also scratches and dents with very little impact
check engine lights comes on occasionally and most of the time the dealership isn't sure what it is and there is a significant cost for them to check on what they think t might be so i opt to not do it and eventually the light comes off
front door latch catches before engaging
chips on front spoiler and ground affects side panels
changed phone but system did not recognize and sync is now unreliable
fell apart
excessive wear
thermostat required replacement
the plastic film covering the silver trim along the windows started to separate within the first year
coupled with the loud fan and run-flat tires adding wind noise just makes this car even noiser
when sold with white rims this just looks awful
 when it rains hard as it is likely to do in florida one of the doors sends a faulty warning signal regarding the window as this is a 4-door car i have no idea which door/window is the problem
the xm radio system is difficult to browse to different stations so you are pretty much stuck with your presets also the headphone jack is not designed to seat the male adapter well and this leads to poor sound quality and frustration
it's just loud
usually this is a problem in the mornings
cup holders sit on rail and require a rail mounting base the plastic clips to hold the cup holders onto this mounting base broke on both rear cup holders
passenger vanity visor mirror cover which activates light totally broke off and dealer replaced under warranty
spark plugs failed at 45000 miles
battery has failed three times since purchase always at first cold snap of season when the temperature hits 32 degrees even though car is garaged in florida i have now undertaken a routine of manually powering off of all systems when i shut off t
there was a surface imperfection in the hood that caused pitting and rust blooms mini had it inspected and the body specialist agreed with me that it was a factory defect  car was out of service for 7 days total
rear door speakers rattled since i took delivery finally asked mini about it and they replaced the brackets and screens of the speakers
they rattle all the time poor design
there was a fuel pump issue with this year not a recall but a watch for apparently  car was out of in the shop for over one week for this issue
idles rough sometimes but mini doesn't see this as a problem because the check engine light isn't coming on
started receiving a message saying low battery warning and called mini to ask if i should bring it in they suggested i watch it for a while and if it becomes a problem set up an appointment  the battery died a couple days later and i had to ha

some times you cannot get a dvd to move past the opening menu
i use a garmin instead  nissan is difficult and slow  cannot input while vehicle is in motion
paint peals and or fades right away just with a simple bit of tree sap left over night chips and dings are almost immediately evident from light rubs
vehicle experiences an order that is foul almost pickle trash like especially during the season changes from hot to cold
the vehicle is very fuel hungry it gets 115 miles to the gallon which sucks
there is an exhaust leak that sounds like a tapping sound all the time
when parked the vehicle's gear shift is very hard to put into gear due to a binding problem when in an incline of any sort
turning a purplish color from black and looks like it's wearing badly
very disappointed with the paint of this 3 year old armada
noisy nissan brakes are notorious
driver information display screen would previously display low fuel
the frion gas was replaced and it is working fine now
nosy compartment  i open & close it several times and try to move the closed compartment door to try & settle it into the closure
interior materials & their high usage areas in the car scuff way too easily and do not clean up well at all this is very disappointing  especially since this is my 6th nissan vehicle!!!
 the catalytic converter cover makes this grating/vibrating noise going uphill while the vehicle is on it's first drive of the day or when the temperature is cooler60's degrees
armada is in park on a hill and transition out of park to drive is very rough

the paint is too soft!
the paint on the driver's side rear wheel well area bubbled/peeled/rusted in just one small area  it was under warranty and was fixed at the dealership but it is now coming back
one spot of flaking paint fixed under warranty at dealership but coming back now
the paint is too soft!
the paint is too soft!
the paint is too soft!
paint is very soft and easily scratched a dry falling leaf hitting the paint would likely scratch the paint  paint job is very fragile for a truck multiple scratches all over truck already and i use a truck gently
happened after i replaced tires on the truck that had worn out at 25k miles
the paint is too soft!
we are an active outdoors sports family hunting fishing skiing etc we use the truck bed a lot  the tailgate squeaks and has some corrosion around the bottom lip of the tailgate  we are still within warranty and hope to get the vehicle
i took the vehicle to dealer to inquire and they said it was normal wear and tear and wasn't covered under the paint protection warranty this infuriates me  this vehicle was a special order truck from irwin motors  it didn't come as we orde
not sure
not sure
not sure
we don't smoke so it's not that big of a deal we have a different outlet to use for cell phone
light scratch marks on fenders hood and rear tailgate  light scratches on fenders tailgate and hood  tried having the truck detailed to see if this would solve the problem at my expense
paint seems very soft and thin never had a truck that scratches so easily entire paint job also came with very noticable orange-peel texture not a good paint job at all
 passenger seat rattles when empty have tried moving it to different positions still rattles and shakes noisy

the paint is missing in spots about 2-4 cm round

noticed paint coming off in the front of the vehicle
it simply has a lot of road noise that is picked up while driving
the dashboard and the door panels are hard to clean and scuff easily
sometimes the engine hesitates when trying to accelerate into traffic or when turning
discoloration all around the gas cap itself same thing on husbands 2011 yaris
i will be on the phone and it will disconnect to where i have to pick up the phone to continue the call
not all of the time but often it won't fully retract
 noisy when driving at high speeds

most likely this is due to being hit but i can't get the molding/trim to fit back together properly and it creates a noise while driving that is annoying
most of these are paint chips due to rocks or other objects hitting the car this causes the paint to chip off since i have some of the car paint i've repainted small sections
sometimes the light says airbag not on other times it says nothing it always says it's on when a person is in the passenger seat so i've not been too concerned as to why sometimes it says it's not on and other times it says nothing
when you hit the dash where it's making a noise it stops for a while it makes me think something has rattled loose

shortly after purchasing the car i noticed paint peeling off at the seams of the bumpers and side panels
the windows drop slightly when the door opens or closes then goes up into the frame when closed i have had issues with it not dropping correctly also when it gets cold the window will not drop causing me to have to violently pull open the door 
appeared the seat cover was not put on correctly you could see the foam at the top of the head rest and the side where the lumbar support handle is which also broke off for no reason
the air doesn't seem to be very cold
the attaching covers of the over head handles were broken on both sides of the car it's a very cheap plastic
low coolant
gas tank never reads full even when filled until the gas dispenser clicks stopped there's a very low mpg no matter highway or city driving
the weight of the door does not allow it to stay open the door moves towards the legs of the passenger when i am inside it can break my leg
please place a device to open the trunk with a sensor under the car like the ford cars
the paint at the bottom of the car looks different than the rest of the car it does not match and looks it is peeling
the problem is that the system does not recognize people with accent please design a bilingual system spanish-english  it is an accent problem

small flaking near front fender and pumper seam on driver's side  have tried to keep touch up paint on this spot
once it was the gas cap once it was some type of vapor leak in emission system

when listening to an ipod there's no easy way to jump to an artist all of the artists have to be scrolled through to get to the desired one this leads to distracted driving because it takes so long when there's thousands of artists in the music
the window clears quickly but i have to keep the settings on defrost or the heat turned up all the way in order to keep the window from fogging back up i also cannot turn on the inside circulation button or the problem will get worse
paint chips easily seems very brittle
only noticed once i  started performing my own oil changes the first three 30000 mile were performed by dealer
